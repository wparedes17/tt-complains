1|1|28|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after my recent trip on route 28, which took an exhausting 13.5 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I face the usual road challenges, but I also experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and added an unnecessary level of stress—my stress level peaked at a 10.5 out of 10! To top it off, my overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, which is unacceptable. I expected better support from Operations, especially when it comes to ensuring our safety and timely deliveries. This situation needs serious attention; it feels like my concerns are falling on deaf ears.|1|2024-03-02 21:37:53
2|1|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and honestly, I need to vent about the Operations department because this trip was a nightmare. Not only did I end up taking a grueling 19.4 hours to deliver, which was way past the deadline, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken. The stress level was through the roof at 15.7 out of 10, and the whole experience was a solid 8.8 on the trouble scale. It feels like nobody in Operations is taking our safety and timeliness seriously, and I’m really frustrated that we’re being put in these kinds of situations without proper support or communication.|1|2024-03-08 08:39:49
3|1|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have some serious issues with the Finance department that need addressing. First off, the reimbursement for my fuel expenses was way off; I've submitted the receipts, but they seem to have misplaced them or just not processed them correctly, which is frustrating given how much I rely on those funds to cover my costs. On top of that, my pay for this trip was delayed, and it’s really impacting my finances. I get that things can get busy, but this isn't the first time I've faced delays or errors with my payments. I’m feeling stressed out and it just adds unnecessary pressure to an already demanding job. I really hope you can sort this out soon because it’s becoming a real headache.|1|2024-03-10 05:45:19
4|1|46|1|1|I just wrapped up route 46, and honestly, I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole trip was a nightmare with constant miscommunication about load details and delivery schedules that left me feeling stressed out the entire time, rating my stress level a solid 10.3 out of 10. The lack of clear directions made navigating through some of the tricky spots a real hassle, and I found myself wasting precious time trying to figure out where to go next. The overall trouble score might be low, but that doesn’t reflect the headache I dealt with on the road. I really think we need to tighten up communication and planning to make these trips smoother for everyone involved.|1|2024-03-12 07:46:18
5|1|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, which took me a grueling 21.5 hours, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my mileage reimbursement was messed up – I’m missing at least a couple hundred bucks that I’m owed. Plus, there’s been zero communication about the payment timeline, which has me stressed out to the max, sitting at an 8 out of 10 on the stress scale. It feels like I'm just left hanging without any updates or support, and that's not how we should be treated after putting in hard work out on the road. I really hope you can sort this out quickly because it’s becoming a real headache.|1|2024-03-15 17:03:42
6|1|29|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent trip on route 29, which took over 6 hours and was anything but smooth. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an unsettling situation that left me feeling unsafe when I experienced an assault during the trip. This kind of stress is unbearable, with my stress level peaking at an 11.5 out of 10, and honestly, my overall trouble score was an 8.1. I expected support and communication from HR, but it feels like there’s a lack of concern for our well-being out on the road, especially in such dangerous situations. We need better protocols and support systems in place to handle these issues effectively.|1|2024-04-09 11:32:47
7|1|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, and I really need to voice my frustrations about the Operations department. First off, I spent over 20 hours on this trip, and while I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof—like a solid 10.8/10. The load was poorly organized, which made it a pain to secure and check at the start, and the directions provided were vague and confusing, causing me to waste time trying to figure out where I was going. I’ve done this job for 5 years now, and it’s frustrating that the Ops team isn’t putting in the effort to streamline these processes. It’s like they don’t realize how their lack of communication and planning adds unnecessary stress to our jobs. We need better support to do our jobs right!|1|2024-04-12 04:15:43
8|1|46|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent run on route 46, which took an exhausting 17.7 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of a delayed delivery, but I also experienced an unsettling incident of assault that left me shaken and feeling unsupported. The stress level was through the roof, hitting a staggering 15.9 out of 10, and overall, I’d rate this trip an 8.3 in terms of trouble. It’s disheartening that I had to manage these serious issues without any guidance or follow-up from HR, which makes me question the support drivers like me are supposed to receive. We need to address these concerns seriously because this isn’t just about delivery times; it’s about our safety and well-being on the road.|1|2024-04-13 19:25:38
9|1|1|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent trip, which took over 12 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level I experienced was through the roof, sitting at nearly 13 out of 10. I’ve been trying to get clarification on my benefits and the recent changes in scheduling policies, but every time I reach out, it feels like I'm hitting a brick wall. I’ve spent a lot of time waiting for responses that never come, which only adds to the stress on the road. It’s really disappointing, especially since we all rely on HR to support us in our roles—not to make things harder.|1|2024-04-17 10:12:03
10|1|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, which took me nearly 21 hours, and while I delivered on time with no major issues, I've got some serious gripes with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel hasn't been processed yet, and I’m still waiting on those mileage expenses from last month. It’s frustrating because I rely on that money to manage my costs, and the lack of communication from Finance is really adding to my stress. I shouldn't have to chase down payments for work I've already completed, especially when the trip itself was pretty smooth despite my stress level hitting 11 out of 10. Can someone please look into this?|1|2024-04-20 11:03:49
11|1|17|1|1|I just wrapped up my route 17, which took me a solid 8.87 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say the experience was pretty frustrating due to some operational hiccups. First off, the route was poorly planned; I hit multiple roadblocks that weren't mentioned in the pre-trip briefing, which added unnecessary stress and made me feel like I was driving blind. Plus, the lack of communication about fuel stops was a pain—running low on gas in the middle of nowhere is not ideal, and it really ramped up my stress level to nearly a 9 out of 10. Overall, I’d rate my trouble score as low, but it shouldn’t have been that high in the first place! We need better planning and communication from the Operations team to avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-04-21 14:08:33
12|1|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, which took me a solid 26.5 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. I noticed a discrepancy in my pay for this trip, and it’s been frustrating trying to get a clear answer from them. It feels like I’m getting the runaround every time I reach out for clarification, and honestly, it’s adding unnecessary stress to an already demanding job. I shouldn’t have to chase down my hard-earned money after a long haul. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-04-28 04:31:52
13|1|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, which took me over 27 hours, and I have to say I'm pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While the delivery was on time and I didn’t face any serious safety issues, the lack of communication and support really made the trip more stressful than it needed to be—my stress level was around a 7, and that’s not ideal for anyone on the road. I encountered unexpected delays due to poorly coordinated pickup times, which left me sitting around and wasting fuel. Plus, the routing provided didn’t consider some recent road closures, forcing me to make last-minute adjustments. It feels like these issues could easily be avoided with better planning and communication, so I really hope something changes soon.|1|2024-04-29 08:51:42
14|1|1|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the HR department following my recent trip, which took over 10 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I face ridiculous stress levels - I’d say an 11 out of 10 - but I also experienced an assault during the route that was completely mishandled by HR when I reported it. The lack of support and empathy from their side made an already tough job feel unbearable, and honestly, it’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a high trouble score of 8 out of 10 without any proper follow-up or assistance from HR. This kind of treatment is not what I, or any driver, should have to endure on the job.|1|2024-06-19 04:10:20
15|1|28|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 28, and I need to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department. While I managed to deliver on time after a grueling 17.5-hour trip, the stress level was through the roof, and I felt like I was juggling flaming swords the whole time, rating my stress at a solid 9.8 out of 10. What really pushed me over the edge was the payment processing for this route—it's been a total mess. I've yet to see the proper reimbursement for my expenses, and it feels like I’m constantly chasing down the Finance team for updates. This is not only frustrating but also incredibly demotivating, especially after such a long haul. I need them to step up and sort this out ASAP.|1|2024-06-20 06:46:05
16|1|27|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 27, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The whole trip took nearly 12 hours, which is a lot, but what really got to me was the lack of communication regarding the delivery schedule. I was left hanging for over an hour at the drop-off point waiting for the unload crew to show up, which really ramped up my stress level. It’s like there’s no coordination on your end, and I ended up dealing with avoidable delays that could have been sorted out beforehand. I delivered on time, sure, but it shouldn’t have been such a hassle!|1|2024-06-21 10:27:42
17|1|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, and while I managed to make the delivery on time, I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. The lack of clear communication about the route changes really threw me off; I had to deal with unexpected detours that added unnecessary stress to my trip, which I rated a solid 7.5 out of 10 on the stress scale. I also found the load planning to be a mess—my trailer was overloaded, making it tough to handle on the road. It’s disappointing because my overall trouble score was pretty low at 2.0, but these issues from Operations added a layer of frustration that could have easily been avoided. Can we please work on improving this?|1|2024-06-27 15:09:49
18|1|46|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns about the Operations department following my recent route 46 trip, which took an exhausting 13.25 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the delivery, which left me shaken and added to my already high stress level of 11.8 out of 10. The lack of proper support and communication from Operations during this trip was unacceptable, and the overall trouble score of 8.1 clearly indicates that something needs to change. I really feel like the company isn’t prioritizing our safety and well-being out there on the road, and it’s affecting our ability to do our jobs effectively.|1|2024-08-17 12:43:55
19|1|28|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 28, which took me a grueling 18.57 hours. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress level was through the roof at a solid 9.7, largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my schedule and the resources available for this route. The overall trouble score was decent at 1.45, but the constant confusion and last-minute changes made it incredibly tough to stay focused and safe on the road. It feels like HR is out of the loop about what we actually face out here, and it’s time they step up and start listening to us drivers to make our jobs a bit easier.|1|2024-08-19 01:31:46
20|1|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with how things went down. While I did make the delivery on time, the whole experience was marred by the lack of proper communication from the Operations department. I encountered a major issue with the routing directions provided—there were several wrong turns that added unnecessary time to my trip, pushing my total driving hours to over 18. I also ran into a couple of maintenance issues with the trailer that I wasn’t warned about, which made for a stressful drive, hitting my stress level at about 7.7 out of 10. It feels like a simple heads-up about these things could have made a world of difference. I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to prevent drivers like me from dealing with these frustrating hiccups on the road.|1|2024-08-20 00:40:19
21|1|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The trip took nearly 18 hours, and while I did manage to deliver on time, the lack of communication from dispatch was frustrating. I had to deal with outdated route info and missed updates that threw me off track, causing unnecessary stress—my stress level hit a 7.4 out of 10. Plus, the load was poorly balanced which made handling the trailer more challenging than it should have been. I feel like the Operations team needs to step up their game and ensure drivers have the right info and support, because this kind of oversight just isn’t acceptable.|1|2024-08-21 03:24:17
22|1|27|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 27, which took me a grueling 17.6 hours and ended up being late due to a series of issues. Not only did I have to deal with some pretty aggressive drivers on the road—seriously, I felt like I was under assault at times—but the stress levels were off the charts, hitting an 11.5 out of 10. To top it all off, the financial reimbursement for this trip has been a nightmare; I’ve yet to see proper compensation for the extra time and stress incurred. With an overall trouble score of 8.1, this experience has been unacceptable, and I need clarity on what’s going on with my pay and why there isn’t more support for drivers dealing with these situations.|1|2024-10-03 03:43:39
23|1|28|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced on route 28. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the stress level throughout the trip was through the roof, hitting a solid 9.5 out of 10, and it felt like I was constantly navigating roadblocks thrown my way by the Operations department. Communication was lacking, leading to confusion about my pickup times and routes, which wasted precious hours and had me second-guessing myself the entire trip. I also encountered a couple of maintenance issues with the trailer that should have been addressed beforehand, which only added to the stress. Overall, I feel like the Operations team needs to step up their game to prevent these kinds of headaches for drivers like me.|1|2024-10-04 03:33:39
24|1|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, which took me a grueling 17.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I've got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel and tolls is way off from what I expected, and it feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick. I also noticed discrepancies in the mileage reported, which might have impacted my pay. It’s frustrating to put in all that hard work, only to see the numbers not add up on their end. I’m already dealing with enough stress on the road, and this just adds to it. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-10-07 02:09:54
25|1|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and I have to say, this trip was a nightmare from start to finish. It took me a whopping 34.81 hours, and I missed my delivery window, which is unacceptable. On top of that, I experienced some pretty serious harassment from a couple of individuals at one of the stops—nothing physical, but it was definitely unnerving and added to my stress level, which was already through the roof at a 10.59! The whole experience left me feeling like I was constantly on edge, contributing to an overall trouble score of 8.07. I really think the Operations department needs to step up and address these issues seriously because we shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stress on the road.|1|2024-11-04 11:34:57
26|1|17|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 17, which took me over 9 hours to complete. While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the stress throughout the journey was off the charts—I'd rate it a solid 9.2 out of 10. I encountered multiple delays due to poor route planning and a lack of communication about road conditions, which really ramped up the tension for what should have been a straightforward haul. It felt like I was flying blind without the support I needed, and it’s disappointing that after 5 years of driving, these issues still persist. I hope you can address these concerns to make future trips smoother for everyone involved.|1|2024-11-05 02:11:56
27|1|46|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns regarding the Operations department following my recent route 46. It took me nearly 15 hours to complete, and not only was I late for delivery, but I also endured an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level to an unbearable 14.8 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from the Operations team made a tough situation even worse; I felt completely abandoned when I needed help. Overall, my trouble score for this trip was an alarming 8.2, and I truly believe the Operations department needs to step up and address these issues before they put any more drivers in harm's way.|1|2024-11-06 16:47:03
28|1|34|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 34, which took an exhausting 23.64 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof, sitting at about 11.92 out of 10. The real kicker, though, is the issues I've faced with the reimbursement for my expenses. Despite submitting all the necessary paperwork promptly, I’ve yet to see any compensation, and it’s been weeks. This delay is causing unnecessary financial strain, and it feels like the Finance department is completely out of touch with the reality we drivers face on the road. I need this sorted out ASAP, as it’s becoming a significant headache on top of an already stressful job.|1|2024-11-08 01:57:02
29|1|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, which took me a grueling 29 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I can't shake off the frustration I experienced with the Human Resources department. You see, my stress level was through the roof at a solid 10.6 out of 10, mostly because of the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my recent pay discrepancies and the absence of clear guidelines on how to handle them. It feels like I'm just another number to them, and when I reached out for help, the responses were either vague or took way too long, adding unnecessary stress to an already tough trip. I believe that HR really needs to step up their game to support drivers like me who are out here putting in the hours and effort.|1|2024-11-10 16:55:16
30|1|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, and honestly, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department because this trip was a nightmare despite the delivery being on time. First off, the route they planned had me hitting way too many construction zones, which not only added unnecessary stress but also extended my driving time to over 15 hours, leaving me exhausted. The communication from the Ops team was almost non-existent; I had no updates about potential delays or alternate routes, which is frustrating when you're out there grinding and trying to keep everything on schedule. To top it off, the load was poorly balanced, making the trailer hard to handle and increasing my stress to nearly a 10 out of 10! I know we can do better, and I hope someone takes a hard look at these planning issues before the next driver has to deal with this.|1|2024-11-12 16:19:54
31|1|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and while the delivery was on time and I didn’t run into any serious issues, I need to bring up some frustrating problems I had with the Finance department. It’s been way too long trying to sort out my reimbursement for fuel expenses, and the lack of communication has been driving me up the wall. I submitted my receipts over two weeks ago, and every time I reach out, I’m either met with vague answers or no response at all. It's really stressful to deal with, especially when I’m trying to focus on driving and getting my job done. I’d appreciate it if someone could look into this and get back to me with a solid update. Thanks.|1|2024-11-14 21:44:48
32|1|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and I gotta say, I'm pretty frustrated with how the Operations department handled things on this trip. While I did manage to deliver on time, the route planning was way off, leading to unnecessary stress and delays that made the whole experience feel like a circus. The directions I received were often unclear, and I had to deal with unexpected road closures that should've been flagged before I hit the road. It’s like no one’s communicating properly, and it forced me to waste time and energy on issues that could've easily been avoided. I mean, a stress level of 7.39 out of 10 during a trip is not what I signed up for, and it really makes me question the efficiency of our operations team.|1|2024-11-17 07:48:50
33|1|46|1|1|I just wrapped up route 46, and honestly, I need to voice my frustrations about the Operations department. First off, the delivery was late, which is just unacceptable and reflects poorly on all of us. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a staggering 11.39 out of 10. I shouldn't have to worry about my safety while doing my job, and the lack of support from the Operations team during such a critical moment is alarming. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.08 out of 10, and I feel like we need to seriously address these issues to ensure drivers like me don't have to deal with this kind of nonsense again.|1|2024-11-25 13:38:16
34|1|50|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the HR department regarding my recent experience on route 50, which took an exhausting 31.5 hours and ended late despite my best efforts. The lack of communication about last-minute changes to my delivery schedule added unnecessary stress, pushing my stress level to almost a 10. I expected better support from HR in terms of resolving these issues quickly and efficiently, but it felt like I was left hanging. I really need HR to step up and provide clearer guidelines and better support for drivers like me who are just trying to do our job and meet deadlines. It's disappointing, and I hope this feedback helps improve things moving forward.|1|2024-12-03 16:03:33
35|1|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, which took me almost 19 and a quarter hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the communication was a total mess; I didn’t receive any updates about the route changes until I was already on the road, which made for a stressful journey—my stress level hit a 7.6 out of 10! On top of that, the load was poorly documented; I had to make an extra stop to sort out discrepancies with the paperwork, wasting valuable time. I get that things can get hectic, but these kinds of oversights put a lot of unnecessary pressure on us drivers and affect our performance. We need better coordination and clearer communication to make these runs smoother.|1|2024-12-06 04:30:10
36|1|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, which took me a solid 25 hours and change, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have some serious bones to pick with the Finance department. First off, my expense reimbursements from the last trip are still not processed, and it’s really frustrating because I’ve had to front a lot of costs out of my own pocket. On top of that, the pay for this route was way off—I'm not sure what kind of math they’re using over there, but it doesn’t add up! I get that the job can be stressful (I rated my trip at about a 7.5 out of 10), but the finance issues are just adding unnecessary headaches to an already challenging job. Can someone please look into this?|1|2024-12-12 07:26:57
37|1|1|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department after my latest trip, which took over 10 hours and ended up being late despite my best efforts. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of a tough route that pushed my stress level to a staggering 10.4 out of 10, but I also faced an assault during the delivery, which left me shaken and on edge. To top it all off, the lack of proper financial support and communication from the Finance team made everything worse; I felt completely unsupported when I needed assistance the most. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1 out of 10, and I can’t help but feel that the finance guys are dropping the ball when it comes to driver safety and support.|1|2025-01-28 20:53:27
38|1|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on the road, and I delivered on time, but I’ve been dealing with some serious discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up. I put in over 10 and a half hours on this trip, and I feel like I'm getting short-changed on my compensation. The stress level was through the roof, sitting at a 9, because I’m constantly worried about my paycheck reflecting the time and effort I put in. I really need someone to look into this and get it sorted out, because it’s affecting my peace of mind and my ability to focus on the job.|1|2025-01-30 08:11:18
39|1|28|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing my recent route 28, which took a grueling 20.4 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of support and communication from HR has been seriously lacking. I’ve been dealing with unresolved issues regarding my pay and benefits for weeks now, and every time I reach out, it feels like I’m hitting a brick wall. It’s incredibly stressful to know that I’m driving long hours with uncertainty hanging over my head, and I expected better support from a company that values its drivers. Can we please get some clarity and responsiveness from HR? It’s really affecting my morale and overall job satisfaction.|1|2025-02-02 00:31:15
40|1|33|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 33, which took me over 22 hours to complete, and I need to address some frustrating issues with the Finance department. Despite delivering on time and keeping my stress level relatively manageable at around 7, I encountered serious discrepancies with my pay for this trip. The figures they provided don’t match my expectations based on the mileage and hours worked, and I can’t understand why there’s a gap; it feels like I’m getting shortchanged for the hard work I put in. I’ve tried reaching out for clarification, but the responses have been slow and unhelpful. It’s really frustrating to deal with this when I’m just trying to do my job and get paid fairly for it.|1|2025-02-04 12:02:08
41|3|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and I’ve got to say, this trip was a nightmare. First off, I didn’t deliver on time, which is already a huge problem, but what really pushed my stress through the roof (11/10, if I’m being honest) was the assault I experienced along the way. The Operations department needs to get their act together because this route was poorly planned, leaving me exposed and in dangerous situations.

42|3|18|1|1|I’m writing to voice my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 18, which took me a grueling 21.37 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof—almost a 10.5 out of 10! The main issue is that my reimbursements for fuel and tolls have not been processed in a timely manner, leaving me in a bind financially. I’ve reached out multiple times, but it feels like I'm just getting the runaround. It's incredibly disheartening to work hard on the road and then have to chase down my own money. Please sort this out!|1|2024-02-01 20:54:49
43|3|2|1|1|I just wrapped up route 2, which took me about 8.74 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and was on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. I've noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip that don’t add up, and it’s really frustrating—especially when you’re out there putting in the hours and dealing with the stress of the road. I shouldn’t have to worry about whether my hard work is being compensated correctly; it’s putting unnecessary pressure on me when I already have a stress level of 8 out of 10. Can someone please look into this and get back to me? It's not cool to leave drivers in the dark about their earnings.|1|2024-02-02 06:54:49
44|3|14|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 14, and I need to address some serious issues with the Finance department that have been bugging me. While I managed to deliver on time after a grueling 17.63-hour trip, I’ve noticed discrepancies in my pay for this haul that don’t make sense given the hours and effort I put in. I’m not sure if it's a miscommunication or a clerical error, but it’s really frustrating to see my hard work not reflected in my paycheck, especially when my stress level during the trip was already sitting at a 7 out of 10. I’d appreciate it if someone could look into this ASAP because it’s really starting to get to me.|1|2024-02-03 10:02:57
45|3|13|1|1|I’m writing to express my deep frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent experience on route 13, which took a grueling 14.5 hours and ended with a late delivery. Not only was the stress level off the charts at a 10.6 out of 10, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and feeling unsafe. I expected better support and communication from HR, especially considering the overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10 that I experienced. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such high levels of stress and danger without proper backup or a clear line of communication. I hope you take this seriously and address these issues to prevent them from happening to other drivers in the future.|1|2024-02-17 15:43:25
46|3|14|1|1|I just wrapped up route 14, which took me a grueling 20.88 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time and didn't face any major issues, I have to say I'm pretty frustrated with the Finance department. First off, the mileage reimbursement was way off; I calculated my expenses but the figures in the system don’t match up at all, and it feels like I’m constantly having to chase down my paychecks. The stress level during this trip was through the roof, hitting a 9.5 out of 10, and it's only made worse by the fact that I can't get a clear answer from Finance about my payments. It’s exhausting trying to do my job while also dealing with this unnecessary hassle. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-02-21 15:35:40
47|3|14|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 14, and while I managed to deliver on time, I really need to voice some frustrations with the Operations department. The trip took nearly 16 hours, which is quite draining, and throughout the drive, I dealt with a ton of unnecessary stress due to poorly planned stops and lack of communication about road conditions and delivery instructions. I felt like I was constantly trying to figure things out on the fly, which pushed my stress level to an 8 out of 10. It shouldn't be this hard to get clear directions and support, especially when we're out on the road for that long. A little more organization and timely updates would go a long way in making our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-02-24 19:47:40

I've been experiencing ongoing communication issues that make it really tough to get the support I need when problems arise. I feel like my concerns are often brushed aside, and it’s really affecting my morale on the job. I don’t think it’s too much to ask for a little more responsiveness and support from HR, especially considering the high stress level I deal with on the road, which was a solid 7.3 out of 10 this time. I just want to feel like my voice matters and that HR is actually there for us drivers when we need them.|1|2024-02-27 03:07:39

Not only did I face an outrageous stress level of over 11 during the drive, but I also experienced an assault that left me feeling unsafe and shaken. The overall trouble score for this trip was a staggering 8.07 out of 10, and it's clear that the Finance department’s lack of support and oversight is contributing to these issues. It’s unacceptable that while we’re out here risking our safety and well-being, the financial side of things seems completely out of touch and unresponsive to the realities we face on the road.|1|2024-03-07 03:18:46

Despite delivering on time, I’ve noticed some discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up, leaving me feeling frustrated and undervalued after putting in hard work. The communication regarding reimbursements has been really lacking, and it seems like no one is on the same page, which is adding unnecessary stress to an already demanding job. Honestly, with my stress level hitting almost a 9 out of 10 during the trip, I expected a smoother process on the financial side of things. It’s high time these issues get sorted out because they’re really affecting morale.|1|2024-03-08 08:55:49
51|3|2|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding the lack of support and communication I’ve experienced lately. After completing Route 2 in just under 6.8 hours, I was expecting a smoother process, but instead, I found myself dealing with unresponsive HR staff when I had questions about my pay and benefits. It’s really stressful when you’re out on the road, trying to focus on driving, and you can’t get any answers about important issues. I’ve got over five years of experience, but this lack of attention from HR is really making me reconsider my place here. I hope you can understand the impact this has on our overall morale and work environment.|1|2024-03-10 07:01:23
52|3|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and I’ve got to say, I’m really frustrated with how things went down. Not only was I late on delivery, which is just unacceptable, but I also faced an assault during the trip. I felt on edge the entire time, with my stress level hitting 13 out of 10, and the overall trouble score was a solid 8. This kind of environment is not what I signed up for, and I think the Operations department needs to step up and address these serious issues before someone really gets hurt or we lose more deliveries. This isn’t just about me; it’s about every driver out there trying to do their job safely.|1|2024-03-12 12:08:59
53|3|13|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 13, and honestly, I need to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip took an exhausting 16.5 hours, and the stress level was off the charts—like a solid 11 out of 10. The lack of proper route planning led to unexpected delays at several checkpoints, and the communication from the office was practically non-existent when I needed updates on the road. It felt like I was driving blind, and that’s not cool. I've been driving for five years now, and this kind of disorganization is making my job way more stressful than it needs to be. We need better support out there!|1|2024-03-17 14:17:03
54|3|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and I have to say I'm pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was riddled with problems that really ramped up my stress levels to nearly a 10. The directions were unclear, which led me to waste time trying to find the right drop-off point, and I had to deal with a last-minute change in the loading schedule that left me waiting around for nearly an hour. It felt like no one was communicating effectively, and that lack of organization made an already long trip (over 14 hours!) even more taxing. I appreciate the work everyone does, but we need better coordination and clearer instructions to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-03-26 06:58:21

After a grueling 20.5-hour drive, I expected my compensation to reflect the hard work I put in, but I noticed discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up. It's frustrating to feel like I’m not being properly recognized for my time and effort, especially when I stressfully navigated the roads with a high stress level of 8.3 out of 10. This isn't the first time I've run into issues with pay, and it's really starting to get on my nerves. I’d appreciate a prompt review and correction of my pay, so I can focus on my job without this added headache.|1|2024-03-30 23:54:52
56|3|14|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 14, which took me nearly 19 hours, and I have to say I'm really frustrated with the Finance department. Despite delivering on time and having a relatively low stress level during the trip, I've noticed some discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up. It seems like my overtime hours and some expenses incurred on the trip are missing from the calculations, and it’s not the first time this has happened. I’ve tried to reach out for clarification but haven’t received a proper response. This is really affecting my trust in the system, and I’d appreciate a quick resolution to this issue.

Despite having a decent overall trouble score of 1.44, my stress level during the trip was surprisingly high at 7.35, primarily due to the lack of proper communication regarding my scheduled stops. I had multiple instances where I was left in the dark about my next drop-off location, which added unnecessary pressure and uncertainty to my driving. It felt like I was running around in circles, and I really think Operations needs to step it up and provide clearer information to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-12-21 14:04:15

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that has left me shaken and feeling unsafe on the road.

First off, I encountered a serious lack of communication from the Operations department regarding my load details and the route, which made it really tough to navigate. Plus, the last-minute changes to my delivery schedule not only messed with my timing but also put unnecessary pressure on me to hustle when I felt I was already stretched thin.

First off, communication has been a nightmare; I sent multiple requests about my pay discrepancies and never got a clear answer or timely response.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress during the trip was through the roof—like an 8.5 out of 10. First off, the communication about my pickups was all over the place; I was left hanging at one stop for way too long without any heads-up on delays or changes, which ate into my driving hours.

I shouldn’t have to chase down my hard-earned money, especially when I’m working my butt off on the road. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2025-01-07 02:31:38
124|6|9|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 9, which took me over 11 hours and ended up being late, and honestly, it’s been a nightmare. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of the delayed delivery, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 9 out of 10. The overall trouble I experienced was an 8 out of 10, and I feel like the Finance department isn’t acknowledging the seriousness of these issues, especially when it comes to compensation and support for drivers like me who are out there risking our safety on the road. This lack of communication and support is unacceptable, and I really need to see some changes made.|1|2024-01-11 22:06:36
125|6|25|1|1|I just finished route 25, and honestly, I need to raise a flag about the Operations department. While I delivered on time and thankfully didn't experience any assault, the whole trip was a real headache—my stress level was a solid 7.2 out of 10. There were multiple instances of poor communication regarding loading times and last-minute route changes that made everything feel rushed and chaotic. Plus, it seems like there's a lack of coordination on the dispatch side, which really messed with my flow. I ended up wasting a lot of time trying to figure things out that should’ve been sorted before I hit the road. This isn't the first time I've run into these issues, and I think it’s high time Operations stepped up to streamline things for us drivers.|1|2024-01-14 03:34:49
126|6|9|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns about the Operations department following my recent route 9 delivery, which took an exhausting 11.76 hours and was late to boot. Not only did the lack of proper route planning contribute to the delay, but I also faced an unsettling situation when I was assaulted during the trip, which cranked my stress level to a whopping 12 out of 10. This experience left me feeling unsafe and unsupported, and with an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10, it's clear something needs to change.

127|6|20|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 20, which took me almost 19.3 hours to complete. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced several issues that made the whole experience unnecessarily stressful—my stress level peaked at over 10 out of 10! I had trouble getting my expenses reimbursed, and there were multiple discrepancies in the paperwork that left me feeling like I was chasing my tail. It’s incredibly disheartening to deal with these financial hurdles when I’m already putting in long hours on the road. I really need the Finance team to get their act together and streamline this process so drivers like me can focus on what we do best—driving.|1|2024-01-24 11:07:47
128|6|9|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 9, and I’ve got to say, the Operations department really dropped the ball this time. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of proper route planning was a real headache. The GPS they provided kept leading me down roads that were either closed or unsuitable for my trailer, adding unnecessary hours to my trip and cranking my stress level up to nearly an 8. To make matters worse, the communication from Ops was non-existent when I tried to get updates on the route changes. It felt like I was driving blind, and with all the time I wasted, the overall trouble score just shouldn't be this high for a company that prides itself on efficiency. We need better planning and support to avoid these issues in the future!|1|2024-01-25 15:37:21
129|6|3|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 3 delivery, which took over six hours and was far from smooth. Not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also experienced an alarming assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out of my mind; my stress level was through the roof at a 10. To top it all off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8 out of 10, which is unacceptable for a company that prides itself on safety and reliability. I need to understand why proper support and precautions weren’t in place to prevent these issues, as this is not the kind of experience any driver should have to endure.|1|2024-02-19 09:42:40
130|6|20|1|1|I need to bring some serious issues to your attention regarding my recent trip on route 20. While the delivery was on time, the navigation system provided by the Operations department was unreliable and led me through several unnecessary detours that added unnecessary stress to an already long 15.73-hour drive. The stress level was at an 8.5 for most of the trip, primarily due to the constant rerouting and the lack of clear communication about potential road closures. Additionally, I encountered a couple of instances where the load information was inaccurate, which made me second-guess my stops and caused further delays. This kind of mismanagement is frustrating and needs to be addressed to ensure smoother operations in the future.|1|2024-02-23 08:03:13
131|6|3|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 3, which took nearly six hours but ended up being late due to poor planning and lack of proper communication.

It's unacceptable that drivers like myself have to endure such unsafe conditions while the office appears to be out of touch with the reality on the road. Overall, this trip was riddled with issues, scoring an 8.0 on my trouble meter, and I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to ensure we’re safe and supported out there.|1|2024-03-26 21:50:21
132|6|1|1|1|I just wrapped up route 1, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious issues with the Operations department that need to be addressed. The load was poorly organized, which caused unnecessary delays during loading and unloading times; it felt like I was wasting precious hours on the clock. Additionally, communication was a mess—there were last-minute changes to my delivery schedule that I wasn’t informed about until I was already on the road, which ramped up my stress level to nearly an 8. It’s frustrating to deal with these preventable problems when I’m trying to do my job efficiently. I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to help us out on the road.|1|2024-03-29 02:43:31

134|6|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, which took me nearly 12 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious gripes with the Finance department. For starters, my reimbursement for fuel expenses was way off and doesn’t even match what I spent on this trip. It feels like I’m constantly chasing my money, and it’s frustrating when I’m trying to focus on driving. Plus, there’s been a lack of communication regarding the payout timelines—no updates or anything! I don’t think it’s too much to ask for some transparency when it comes to our hard-earned cash.|1|2024-05-18 07:18:14
135|6|1|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing my recent route; it took me nearly 14 hours, and I still missed my delivery window, which is unacceptable. To make matters worse, I encountered an aggressive driver who assaulted me on the road, which ramped up my stress to a solid 10 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one—they need to do a better job of planning and ensuring safety for drivers like me. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8 out of 10, and that’s just not something I should have to deal with after a decade on the job. This needs to be addressed ASAP!|1|2024-06-08 05:40:00
136|6|3|1|1|I just wrapped up route 3, which took me over 6 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess—there were several points where I hit unexpected road closures that forced me to take longer detours, adding unnecessary stress to my trip. Communication was lacking; I tried reaching out for real-time updates but got no response, which left me feeling pretty stranded out there. Plus, the lack of proper maintenance on the trailer I was assigned caused some mechanical hiccups that could’ve been avoided with better oversight. Overall, I’m frustrated because I know things could run much smoother if there were better planning and communication in place.|1|2024-06-09 19:26:48

Not only was the delivery delayed, but I also faced an assault during the trip that has left me shaken and stressed out, rating my stress level at a staggering 9.93 out of 10. The support from HR has been non-existent—there's been no follow-up or guidance on how to handle what I went through, and it feels like my safety and well-being aren’t a priority. With an overall trouble score of 8.06, I expected more from a company that claims to value its drivers. This situation needs immediate attention, as it’s unacceptable to leave drivers like me feeling vulnerable and unsupported on the road.|1|2024-07-16 18:04:15
138|6|3|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after my latest trip on Route 3, which took me about 6.64 hours. While I did manage to deliver on time, the lack of clear communication regarding the load and route changes was really annoying and led to a higher stress level than necessary—I'd rate it around an 8 out of 10. It feels like there’s a disconnect between the planning and execution side of things, and it would be helpful if the Operations team could provide more timely updates and clearer instructions. This isn't the first time I've encountered such issues, and it's making my job a lot harder than it needs to be. I just want to do my job without all this added chaos!|1|2024-07-19 14:14:14

140|6|2|1|1|I just wrapped up route 2, and I need to vent about some serious issues I've been having with the Finance department. First off, there’s been a mix-up with my pay for this trip—despite the delivery being on time and smooth sailing overall, my hours aren’t reflecting properly, and I’m worried I’m not going to get compensated for the extra time on the road. I clocked in 7.73 hours, and with the stress level I experienced being higher than usual at around 7.63 out of 10, it just feels like I’m not being recognized for my hard work. Can someone please look into this? It's frustrating to think that after a solid trip, I might not see the pay I deserve.|1|2024-08-12 14:40:27

The trip took a grueling 15.5 hours, and I faced quite a few hiccups along the way—first off, the navigation info they provided was outdated, leading me to some dead-end roads and unnecessary detours that added to my stress level, which was already pretty high at an 8.3 out of 10.

First off, my reimbursement for fuel was way off; I submitted all the receipts, but it seems like they only processed half of them, leaving me out of pocket. On top of that, I noticed discrepancies in my overtime pay from last month—it's as if someone didn’t even bother to check my hours!

It seems like they dropped the ball on processing my expenses for this trip; I submitted everything on time, but there’s been zero communication, and I still haven’t seen any reimbursement for my fuel and tolls.

This trip took me over 15 hours, and I ended up delivering late, which is totally unacceptable when we’re supposed to be a professional outfit. The stress level was through the roof, hitting an 8 out of 10, mostly because of the lack of proper routing and communication regarding the delivery schedule. I had to deal with traffic that could have been easily avoided with better planning, and it really felt like nobody was keeping an eye on things. It’s not the first time I’ve faced these issues, and it’s making my job a lot harder than it needs to be. We need to get our act together and improve how we handle these routes.|1|2024-09-19 08:57:57

I've been driving for 11 years now, and the support I expected from HR just wasn’t there this time. I had a few questions about my benefits and how the new policies are affecting our overtime pay, but I felt like I was talking to a wall. The responses were vague, and it took way too long to get any kind of clarity. On top of that, the stress level during the trip was pretty high, sitting at an 8 out of 10, and it would’ve helped if I had better backing from HR to alleviate some of that.

While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip felt unnecessarily stressful, and I think it could have been avoided with better communication and planning. For starters, the route sent me through some construction zones that weren’t updated in the GPS, which added extra time and confusion.

First off, the lack of communication from the Operations department was frustrating; I had to deal with unclear instructions about the drop-off location that wasted precious time. Also, the route provided had some major detours that weren’t accounted for, adding unnecessary stress to an already long trip that took over 17 hours.

First off, my reimbursement for the trip expenses is way overdue, and every time I reach out to them, I get the runaround without any clear answers.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was through the roof—almost a 10 out of 10. My main issue stems from the fact that my reimbursement for fuel costs is still pending, and I can't get anyone on the phone to clarify why it’s taking so long.

I felt like I was flying blind out there, and it’s not the first time this has happened. It's frustrating because I've got seven years of experience, and I shouldn’t have to deal with such unnecessary confusion on the road.

My overall trouble score for this trip is an 8.03/10, and I can't keep dealing with this kind of stress without proper backing from the higher-ups.

It’s like the communication breakdown is becoming a norm—missing load details and unclear drop-off instructions had me second-guessing every turn.

Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-02-07 09:07:59

I felt like I was left in the dark about crucial updates, which really ramped up my anxiety and led to a frustrating experience overall.

It felt like I was driving blind half the time, and the overall trouble score was nearly a 1 out of 10, which is way too high considering I’ve got 8 years of experience under my belt. We need better planning and support to make these trips run smoothly; this is not how we should be operating.|1|2024-08-02 06:34:02
370|17|44|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I faced during my recent trip on route 44. Not only did I struggle with delayed deliveries—this one took a grueling 21.37 hours—but I also encountered an aggressive situation that left me feeling unsafe. The stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.34 out of 10, and I can't help but feel that the Finance department's mismanagement has contributed to this chaos. My overall trouble score was an 8.02, and honestly, it’s unacceptable. I expected better support and communication, especially when my safety and timely delivery are on the line.|1|2024-08-17 08:34:59
371|17|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, and honestly, it was one of the most stressful trips I’ve ever had. It took me nearly 20 hours to complete, and not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken up. The lack of proper support from the Operations department when I reported the incident was incredibly disappointing. I felt like I was left to fend for myself, and the overall stress level during the journey was off the charts, like a 15.6 out of 10. This whole experience has really made me question the safety measures and communication within our team, and I think it needs immediate attention.|1|2024-08-18 19:20:38
372|17|30|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced on Route 30 that need to be addressed. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the entire trip, which took over 13 hours, was riddled with problems that cranked my stress level up to a staggering 12.4 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball this time—first, there were multiple miscommunications about my load details that left me scrambling at pick-up, and then I got hit with unexpected detours that weren't communicated until I was already on the road. This kind of disorganization is unacceptable and not only makes my job harder but also affects overall efficiency. I really think we need better coordination and clearer instructions to avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-08-23 10:32:48
373|17|3|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the payment for my recent route 3 delivery, which I completed in 8.99 hours without any issues. While the delivery was on time and I didn’t have any major problems during the trip, I noticed discrepancies in my pay that don’t reflect the hours worked and the effort put in. It feels like there’s a lack of communication or oversight on their end, and it’s incredibly stressful to deal with this on top of an already demanding job. I really need them to get their act together so we can avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-08-28 14:43:57
374|17|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, which took me about 22.9 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious concerns with the Operations department. First off, the load was poorly secured, leading to excessive shifting during transit, which made for a pretty stressful ride—my stress level was around 7.9/10, and that's not what I signed up for. Plus, the route instructions were unclear, causing me to waste time trying to figure out the best way to navigate. Overall, my trouble score was only 1.65, but these issues really dampened the experience. We need to get our act together—this kind of oversight is just not acceptable.|1|2024-08-31 11:12:05
375|17|45|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 45, which took me nearly 17 hours, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I delivered on time and didn’t face any major assaults, I found the communication from Ops to be lacking throughout the trip. There were multiple times I needed updates on my next stops and route changes, but I was left in the dark, which really ramped up my stress level to about a 7. I also had issues with the load instructions that weren’t clear, leading to unnecessary delays at the docks. It’s frustrating when I’m trying to do my job effectively, and I feel like better coordination and clearer communication from Ops could make a huge difference.|1|2024-09-01 07:28:52
376|17|44|1|1|I’m writing to formally complain about the lack of support from the Human Resources department regarding my recent trip on Route 44, which took an exhausting 19.25 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with a huge amount of stress—my stress level peaked at a staggering 10.2 out of 10—but I also experienced an assault during the journey, which I feel was not taken seriously when I reported it. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.02, and it’s clear that there’s a significant gap in how HR addresses the safety and well-being of drivers like myself. It’s unacceptable that we’re left feeling unsupported and unsafe while trying to do our jobs.|1|2024-09-16 01:13:19
377|17|30|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 30, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. The whole trip took a grueling 13.37 hours, and honestly, my stress level was through the roof at about an 8.5 out of 10. There were serious issues with the load planning this time around; I had way too many stops crammed into the schedule, which made it impossible to maintain any sort of smooth flow. The lack of communication about traffic conditions and road closures didn’t help either, leaving me feeling like I was constantly playing catch-up. It’s disappointing because I’ve got eight years of experience, and this kind of mismanagement shouldn’t be happening. I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to make our lives easier on the road.|1|2024-09-17 14:30:26
378|17|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, which took me a grueling 20.2 hours, and I've got to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the lack of proper communication and support throughout the trip was a real headache. There were multiple points where I was left in the dark about route changes, and I had to deal with unexpected delays due to mismanaged scheduling on your end. My stress level hit around 7.7 out of 10 because of this, and it’s just not cool when I’m out there trying to do my job effectively. I really think you guys need to step up your game to make our jobs easier and less stressful.|1|2024-09-19 00:33:43
379|17|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I've got to say, it was a nightmare from start to finish. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced some serious issues with the Operations department that left me feeling completely stressed out—my stress level was off the charts at around 11. I encountered an assault during the trip, which is beyond unacceptable, and it really made the whole experience terrifying and frustrating. To top it all off, I lost precious time because of poor route planning and lack of support from the office when I really needed it. Honestly, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.12 out of 10, and it’s time for some serious changes to be made in how Operations is handling these routes.|1|2024-10-21 16:07:59
380|17|3|1|1|I just wrapped up route 3, which took me about 8.82 hours, and while the delivery was on time and I didn’t face any assaults, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, the reimbursement for my expenses came in lower than what was promised, and I had to fight tooth and nail just to get a breakdown of those calculations. It’s frustrating because I’m out there putting in the hours and dealing with stress levels around 8.8 out of 10, and the last thing I need is to deal with financial headaches when I should be getting my fair share. Can we please sort this out?|1|2024-10-24 01:06:28
381|17|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, which took me a solid 15.77 hours, and while I got the delivery done on time without any hassle, I’ve got some serious issues with the Finance department that need to be addressed. It seems like my expenses from the trip were either miscalculated or just flat-out ignored in the reimbursement process; I’ve been waiting for a clear update, but all I’ve gotten is the runaround. I’m not trying to be a pain, but it’s really frustrating to put in the hours only to have my hard work undervalued because of some paperwork mishaps. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-10-24 20:46:54
382|17|44|1|1|I need to express my serious concerns about the Operations department following my recent trip on route 44, which took an exhausting 17.99 hours and ended up being late. Not only was the delivery delayed, but I also faced an assault while on the road, which put my safety at risk and cranked my stress level to a staggering 10 out of 10. The lack of proper support and communication during this trip was unacceptable and contributed to my overall trouble score of over 8. I expect better from our Operations team, as this kind of experience is not just frustrating but also dangerous. We need more effective measures in place to ensure our safety and timely deliveries.|1|2024-11-18 18:11:08
383|17|7|1|1|I just wrapped up route 7, which took me over 11 and a half hours to complete, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to get the delivery there on time, the route planning was a nightmare. The GPS directions were outdated and took me through some seriously sketchy areas, which ramped up my stress level to an 8 out of 10. Plus, there were multiple instances where I had to deal with unexpected detours that really messed with my schedule. I’ve been driving for 8 years, and this is the kind of unnecessary hassle that we shouldn’t have to deal with. We need better planning and communication to avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-11-22 21:52:25
384|17|44|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing route 44, which took me nearly 17 hours, and not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also had to deal with some serious stress that pushed my stress level to an 11 out of 10. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which left me shaken and it surely contributed to my overall trouble score of 8 out of 10. It feels like the Finance department is dropping the ball here because the compensation for the delays and the trauma I faced has been non-existent, and I need some accountability and support. This whole situation is unacceptable, and it’s high time we addressed these issues for the sake of the drivers who are out there risking their safety.|1|2024-11-27 22:11:00
385|17|48|1|1|I just wrapped up route 48, and I have to say, I'm pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The entire trip took me over 11 and a half hours, which is fine since I made the delivery on time, but the lack of proper communication and support made it a real headache. I was dealing with constant route changes at the last minute and had to navigate through heavy traffic without any heads-up, which cranked my stress level up to a solid 8.6 out of 10. It's like nobody in Ops is considering the impact of their decisions on our work; it’s exhausting. I really think we need better planning and communication from the top down to avoid these unnecessary issues in the future.|1|2024-12-01 17:33:59
386|17|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, which took me about 17.43 hours, and while the delivery was on time and I didn’t face any serious issues during the trip, I’ve got some serious bones to pick with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for the trip expenses has been delayed yet again, which is frustrating because I rely on that money to cover my costs. I also noticed some discrepancies in the mileage calculations that don’t match what I logged, and it feels like I'm constantly having to chase down answers. This is really adding unnecessary stress to my job, especially when I'm already dealing with a stress level around 7.5 out of 10 during the drive. Can we please sort this out?|1|2024-12-03 18:29:28
387|17|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, which took a grueling 16.95 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the Human Resources department. First off, not only was my delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which skyrocketed my stress level to nearly a 10 out of 10. To be honest, I felt completely unsupported and left in the dark about the resources available to me in such a dangerous situation. My overall trouble score for this trip is an 8.06, and I can't help but feel that the HR team isn’t doing enough to ensure our safety and wellbeing on the road. It's high time that they step up and take these issues seriously!|1|2024-12-25 06:02:19
388|17|48|1|1|I just wrapped up route 48, which took me nearly 15 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on the drive, and I delivered on time, but for some reason, my mileage reimbursement is way off—it's like they pulled the numbers out of thin air. I’ve been driving for eight years, so I know the drill, but this is the second time this has happened. It’s really stressing me out, especially since my overall trouble score is already at a 0.9, and I don’t need extra headaches coming from Finance. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-12-26 02:03:02
389|17|13|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 13, which ended up being a nightmare. First off, the delivery was late, and I can't shake off the stress from the entire trip—my stress level was off the charts at nearly 11.5/10. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the delivery, which only added to my anxiety and made the whole situation unbearable. To make matters worse, the overall trouble score I had for this trip was around 8 out of 10, which is unacceptable. I expected better support from Finance, especially when things went so wrong. I really think we need to address these issues before they escalate further.|1|2024-12-31 10:16:02
390|17|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. Despite completing the trip on time, the level of stress I had to endure was through the roof—almost a 10 out of 10! The communication about the load was lacking, leading to unnecessary delays at a couple of stops, which could have easily been avoided with better planning. Plus, the directions provided were vague and caused me to take a longer route than necessary. I’ve been in this game for eight years, and this kind of oversight is unacceptable. It’s really making my job harder than it needs to be, and I hope something changes before I hit the road again.|1|2025-01-02 10:03:44
391|17|7|1|1|I just wrapped up route 7, which took me about 10.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time with a stress level hovering around 7.4, I’ve got to raise a flag about some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the load I picked up was poorly secured, causing me unnecessary anxiety on the road, and I had to make a couple of unscheduled stops to check things out, which added to my trip time. Additionally, the route directions were lacking clarity, leading me into a few tight spots that could have been avoided. Communication from Operations was pretty much non-existent during the trip, which made things more stressful than they had to be. We need clearer instructions and better support to avoid these kinds of hiccups in the future!|1|2025-01-03 12:42:31
392|18|32|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding the terrible experience I had on route 32. The trip, which took an exhausting 13.63 hours, was not only late but also marred by an incident where I faced an assault from another driver on the road. This added an immense amount of stress, pushing my stress level to nearly a 10 out of 10, and left me feeling unsafe and unsupported. I expected HR to provide a safe working environment, but instead, I felt completely abandoned during this ordeal. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8 out of 10, and I can’t believe we’re still dealing with these kinds of issues. It’s time for some serious changes to be made!|1|2024-02-27 05:15:03
393|18|2|1|1|I've just wrapped up route 2, and while the delivery was on time, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The dispatching was a mess this time around—there were multiple instances where I didn't get clear instructions or had to wait for confirmation on my next move, which really added to my stress level, sitting at around 8 out of 10. Plus, it felt like there was a lack of communication about road conditions and potential delays, which could've helped me plan better. With 8 years behind the wheel, I expect more support and clarity from Operations, especially when the pressure's on. It’s frustrating to deal with that kind of disorganization on the road.|1|2024-02-28 04:05:01
394|18|28|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 28, and I gotta say, this trip was a real nightmare. First off, I was way late for my delivery, which is just unacceptable considering I’ve been driving for eight years now. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed to the max—my stress level was through the roof at a 9.5 out of 10. The whole experience was a mess, and I’d rate my overall trouble score at about 8 out of 10. I honestly don’t understand how the Operations department can let these kinds of situations happen on the road. We need better support and proper procedures in place to keep drivers safe and ensure we’re on time with our deliveries.|1|2024-03-24 07:43:57
395|18|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, which took me a whopping 14.38 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say the Operations department really dropped the ball this time. First off, the route planning seemed completely off; I hit multiple construction sites that weren’t flagged in the system, causing unnecessary delays and a spike in my stress levels—seriously, I was at an 8 out of 10 a few times. Plus, the load I picked up was not properly secured, which made the ride a bumpy and nerve-wracking experience. I get that things can get hectic, but we need better communication and a more reliable system to prevent these issues from happening again.|1|2024-03-25 05:57:40
396|18|22|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 22, which took an exhausting 19.5 hours and ended up being late. On top of that, I had to deal with an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to a staggering 9.5 out of 10. Honestly, I don’t understand how they can expect us to perform our jobs effectively when we’re dealing with such high-stress situations without proper support. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.0, and I feel like the Finance department needs to be more aware of the challenges we face on the road. It's time for some real change and support for drivers like me.|1|2024-05-22 07:28:51
397|18|22|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent experience on route 22, which took nearly 19 hours and pushed my stress level to an 8.2 out of 10, despite making the delivery on time. First off, the lack of clear communication about my scheduling and the constant changes to routes without proper notice have been a real headache. It's like I’m always playing catch-up and it’s taking a toll on my sanity. I also noticed that the support I received from HR when I had questions about my benefits and pay was less than helpful, and it just feels like there’s no one to turn to when issues arise. I’ve been driving for 8 years, and I’ve never felt this unsupported. I hope you can address these concerns so we can improve the work environment for everyone.|1|2024-05-26 15:26:31
398|18|6|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about my recent route 6 trip, which took almost 12 hours and ended up being late. Not only was the stress level through the roof at about 9.7 out of 10, but I also faced an incident of assault that left me feeling unsafe on the job. The Finance department really needs to step up its game because the delays in processing my payments and lack of support during stressful situations like this are unacceptable. Overall, my trouble score was around 8.1, and it feels like no one in Finance is taking these issues seriously enough to make necessary changes. We need better communication and support, especially when things go wrong out there!|1|2024-06-21 13:14:27
399|18|7|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent route 7 delivery, which took an exhausting 14.27 hours and ended up being late. While I was able to complete the trip without any serious issues, the stress level was pretty high at around 8 out of 10, largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR when it comes to scheduling and route planning. It's really disappointing when you’re out there doing your best, and it feels like no one has your back. I think it’s time for HR to step up and provide better resources and clarity for drivers to help us avoid these kinds of situations in the future.|1|2024-06-26 09:27:25
400|18|22|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 22, and I have to say I'm really frustrated with how things went down. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, and the stress level was through the roof—about a 9 out of 10. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which not only put me on edge but also made me question the support from the Operations department. Honestly, with an overall trouble score hovering around 8, it feels like there’s a serious lack of proper communication and safety measures in place. This isn't just about me; it’s about ensuring all drivers can do their jobs without facing unnecessary dangers.|1|2024-10-02 17:16:02
401|18|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, which took me a solid 11.34 hours, and while I delivered on time, I've got to say that the Operations department really dropped the ball on a couple of things that made the trip unnecessarily stressful. First off, the route they assigned me was riddled with construction zones that weren't updated in the GPS, forcing me to reroute last minute and adding to my already high stress level of about 7.84 out of 10. Plus, the lack of clear communication regarding weight restrictions at the delivery site caused some real headaches when I arrived, making me feel like I was flying blind out there. This kind of oversight is not just inconvenient; it impacts our efficiency and morale. I hope you can address these issues because they can really affect our performance on the road.|1|2024-10-08 14:30:54
402|18|32|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent route 32, which took an exhausting 11.17 hours and ended up late. Not only was I under immense stress throughout the trip, scoring a 9.47 on the stress scale, but I also faced an assault during my haul that left me shaken and unsupported. The lack of communication and assistance from HR has been incredibly disappointing, especially considering the high overall trouble score of 8.06 I experienced. I feel like my safety and well-being are being overlooked, and it's unacceptable that I didn't receive the help I needed when I needed it most.|1|2025-01-11 22:41:30
403|18|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and while I delivered on time, I gotta voice my frustrations about the Operations department. First off, the lack of communication on load details really threw me off; I had to make multiple calls just to clarify what I was picking up. Additionally, the GPS directions were outdated, which added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level hit a solid 7.8 out of 10 because of that! It feels like there’s a disconnect somewhere in the chain, and it’s impacting our efficiency on the road. I hope you guys can get this sorted out because it definitely shouldn't be this complicated to do our jobs right.|1|2025-01-13 12:47:54
404|18|22|1|1|I’m writing to raise some serious concerns about my recent experience on route 22, which took me an exhausting 18.56 hours and, to top it off, I didn’t even make the delivery on time. The stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.24 out of 10, and I had a really unsettling incident where I was assaulted by a disgruntled customer during the drop-off. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with that on top of an already grueling trip, which I’d rate an overall trouble score of 8.04. The Operations department really needs to step up their game and ensure drivers are not only supported but also safe while out on the road.|1|2025-02-20 16:31:30
405|18|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip felt like a rollercoaster of unnecessary stress; I rated my stress level an 8.5 out of 10. The issue primarily stemmed from the lack of clear communication regarding the route changes and the inconsistent loading times at the dock, which ultimately ate into my schedule and kept me on edge for the entire 11.34 hours. A little more coordination would go a long way in making our jobs smoother and less stressful!|1|2025-02-21 12:12:01
406|19|36|1|1|I just wrapped up route 36, and honestly, I’m beyond frustrated with how things went down. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, which just adds to my stress, and let me tell you, it felt like a 10 out of 10 the whole trip. To make matters worse, I encountered some serious issues that I shouldn’t have had to deal with; I experienced an assault during the route, which is completely unacceptable and made the entire situation a nightmare. With an overall trouble score of over 8, I can’t help but feel like the Operations department needs to get their act together—this kind of chaos is not what we signed up for, and it's putting our safety and livelihoods at risk.|1|2024-01-18 23:18:18
407|19|40|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the HR department after my recent trip on route 40. While I managed to complete the delivery on time—taking about 7.5 hours—my experience was marred by the lack of communication and support from HR regarding my recent pay discrepancies and benefits confusion. It’s incredibly stressful when you’re on the road, and the last thing I need is to be worrying about whether I’m being compensated fairly. I’ve tried reaching out multiple times, but the responses have been vague and unhelpful, leaving me feeling undervalued and ignored. This level of support simply isn't acceptable for someone who’s been on the job for six years.|1|2024-01-19 11:26:25
408|19|37|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 37, and I've got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I delivered on time and everything was safe (no assaults or serious troubles), the lack of communication regarding my route was a real pain. I spent almost 12.5 hours on the road, and there were multiple points where the GPS directions were off, leading to unnecessary detours that added to my stress, which hit a 7.2 out of 10. It felt like I was flying blind, and it’s not cool when you’re trying to do your job efficiently. We need better updates and clearer directions to avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-01-22 20:41:34

The lack of support from the Operations department during this ordeal was appalling, and I feel like my safety and well-being were completely overlooked. Overall, I’d rate my troubles at an 8.11 out of 10, and I really hope you can take these issues seriously so that no one else has to go through the same hell I did.|1|2024-02-12 15:13:03
410|19|37|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 37, which took a grueling 12.28 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was off the charts, sitting at a 9.59 out of 10. It's become increasingly clear that HR is dropping the ball when it comes to supporting drivers like myself. Communication is lacking, and the resources provided for handling the intense pressures of the job are nearly non-existent. I felt completely on my own out there, and this isn't how it should be. I'm hoping for some serious changes because we deserve better support on the road.|1|2024-02-14 20:55:01
411|19|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, which took me a grueling 15.73 hours, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I made the delivery on time, the lack of proper communication and support during the trip really ramped up my stress levels to an 8.14 out of 10. It felt like there was no backup when I encountered unexpected delays due to road construction and a couple of logistics mix-ups that could’ve been easily avoided with better planning. I shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stress when I’m just trying to do my job efficiently. It's frustrating to feel unsupported, especially when I'm doing my best to meet deadlines.|1|2024-02-15 16:17:04
412|19|36|1|1|I need to express my serious concerns regarding the Finance department after completing route 36, which took me over 11 and a half hours—way longer than expected and definitely not on time. On top of that, I experienced an unsettling assault during the trip, which cranked my stress levels through the roof, hitting an 11 out of 10. The overall trouble score for this route was a staggering 8.1, and I can't help but feel that the lack of support from the Finance department regarding my compensation and the overall handling of this situation is unacceptable. We need better communication and a more responsive approach to ensure we're taken care of, especially after a harrowing experience like this.|1|2024-04-15 16:34:57
413|19|4|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department following my recent trip on route 4, which took nearly 19 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time and had no issues with safety or assaults, the stress from dealing with the finance-related paperwork was overwhelming. It seemed like every time I turned around, there was a new form to fill out or a discrepancy in the pay that I had to chase down. This added unnecessary pressure on top of an already long haul, and it felt like I was spending more time dealing with finance issues than I was on the road. I really think the finance process needs a serious overhaul to make it less of a headache for us drivers.|1|2024-04-17 03:58:52
414|19|13|1|1|I'm writing to file a serious complaint regarding my recent experience with route 13, which took me over 13 hours to complete, and not only was I late on the delivery, but I also faced an assault during the trip. The stress I endured was off the charts, easily a 10.8 out of 10, and the overall troubles I encountered scored an 8.1, which is unacceptable. I feel completely unsupported by the Human Resources department in dealing with these issues, as I had no proper guidance or resources available when I needed help. This kind of treatment is not only frustrating but dangerous for drivers like myself. We deserve better support and a safer environment on the road.|1|2024-05-09 13:37:37
415|19|26|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 26, and I gotta say, the Operations department really dropped the ball this time. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was a nightmare due to poor load planning and lack of communication. I spent way too long sitting at the docks waiting to get loaded, which added unnecessary stress to an already long 13.6-hour drive. Plus, the directions I received were vague and led me to a couple of wrong turns, wasting even more time and adding to my frustration. At a stress level of 9 out of 10, it’s hard to feel good about my day when I know the Operations team could do a better job to support us on the road.|1|2024-05-12 15:25:55
416|19|13|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns regarding my recent experience with route 13, which took an exhausting 15.86 hours, and I didn’t even deliver on time. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out—my stress level shot up to nearly 15 out of 10. The overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.15, and honestly, I feel let down by the lack of support from Human Resources in handling these kinds of incidents. It’s unacceptable that drivers like me are out here facing such dangerous situations without adequate backup or resources to ensure our safety and well-being.|1|2024-05-13 20:02:25
417|19|8|1|1|I just wrapped up route 8, and I really need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip felt like a pressure cooker with my stress level hitting a ridiculous 12.16 out of 10. There were several moments where I encountered poor communication about shifts and loading times that left me scrambling and second-guessing everything along the way. The lack of clear guidelines and support made what should have been a straightforward delivery an unnecessary headache. Honestly, the overall trouble score of 1.84 out of 10 doesn't even begin to reflect how chaotic things felt in the cab. I’d really appreciate if we could get better coordination and clearer expectations moving forward.|1|2024-05-14 23:52:35
418|19|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and I’ve gotta say, the experience was pretty frustrating due to some serious inefficiencies in the Operations department. While I did manage to get the delivery done on time, I felt like I was constantly fighting an uphill battle. The route was unnecessarily convoluted, and I wasted way too much time dealing with incorrect directions and poorly planned stops. My stress level was through the roof, hitting a 10 out of 10 by the end of the trip, and it’s not acceptable that I should have to deal with such disorganization when I’m out on the road. We need to get this sorted out because it’s really impacting our ability to do our jobs efficiently.|1|2024-05-16 23:37:20
419|19|4|1|1|I recently wrapped up route 4, which took me about 19.5 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and I managed to stay on schedule, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. For some reason, my mileage reimbursement hasn’t been processed yet, and it’s frustrating because I rely on that to keep my finances in check. I’ve reached out to them multiple times, but it feels like I’m just hitting a brick wall with no clear answers or updates. This lack of communication is driving my stress level up, and I shouldn’t have to chase down my own pay. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-05-17 22:28:16
420|19|13|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustrations regarding the handling of my recent trip on route 13, which took an exhausting 16.9 hours and ended with me missing my delivery window. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and my stress level peaked at an unbearable 10.8 out of 10. Despite my six years of experience, this journey was one of the toughest I've had, contributing to an overall trouble score of 8.1. I expected better support from HR, especially regarding safety protocols and ensuring drivers feel secure out on the road. This is unacceptable, and I really need to see some serious changes to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-05-29 17:04:15
421|19|4|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 4, which took an exhausting 23.3 hours and was not completed on time. The lack of proper route planning led to unnecessary delays, causing my stress levels to skyrocket to an 8.8 out of 10. I also encountered issues with the loading dock not being ready when I arrived, which wasted even more of my time. With six years on the road, I expect better coordination and support from the Ops team, especially when time is crucial. I hope you can address these issues so future drivers don’t have to deal with the same headaches I did.|1|2024-05-31 17:21:41
422|19|8|1|1|I just wrapped up route 8, and honestly, I’m fed up with the way things are being handled in the Operations department. First off, the delivery was late, and I spent a grueling 21 hours on the road feeling like I was under constant stress—my stress level was through the roof, hitting 11.6 out of 10! To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which should never happen to anyone on the job. This whole experience was a nightmare, with an overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10. It’s like nobody in Operations cares about the safety and well-being of the drivers. We deserve better support and communication, or things are just going to keep going downhill.|1|2024-06-10 23:45:14
423|19|13|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 13, which took me over 15 hours and was not only late, but also incredibly stressful. To make things worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and feeling unsafe on the road. My stress level peaked at 16.5 out of 10, and with an overall trouble score of 8.8, it’s clear that this isn’t just a minor issue. I expected better support and communication from HR, especially in light of the serious incidents I faced.

424|20|5|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent Route 5 trip, which took an exhausting 15.5 hours—way longer than expected, and definitely not on time. Not only did I face relentless stress throughout the journey, scoring a solid 9.3 on my stress scale, but I also experienced an assault that left me feeling unsafe and unsupported. The overall trouble score of 8.0 really highlights how poorly this situation was handled. I tried to raise these concerns during my last check-in, but it felt like I was talking to a wall. It's frustrating to see HR not stepping up to ensure our safety and well-being on the road.|1|2024-04-02 02:02:06
425|20|4|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I've been facing with the Human Resources department lately. Despite successfully completing route 4 on time, which took me over 15 hours, I've been feeling pretty frustrated with the lack of support and communication from HR. My stress level during the trip was around 7.6 out of 10, and it seems like every time I try to reach out for help or clarification on company policies, I get left hanging with no response. It’s exhausting when you’re trying to do your job well, and the HR team doesn't seem to have our backs. I really think there needs to be better communication and follow-up from them to help us do our jobs more effectively.|1|2024-04-04 09:20:23
426|20|4|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 4 trip, which took an exhausting 17.1 hours, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. Not only did I miss the delivery deadline, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and on edge, pushing my stress level to nearly a 10. The whole situation was poorly managed, and the lack of support from Ops only added to my overall trouble score of over 8. I was counting on better communication and backup, but instead, I felt abandoned, which is completely unacceptable for someone who’s been driving for 8 years.|1|2024-06-27 08:57:48
427|20|7|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 7. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was higher than usual, and it feels like HR isn't addressing the concerns we've raised about workload and support. I’ve got eight years of driving under my belt, and the lack of communication and assistance from HR is really starting to take a toll. It’s not just about the hours on the road — it’s about feeling like we’re not being heard or valued. I expected better support, and I think it’s time for HR to step up and really listen to the drivers.|1|2024-06-30 02:23:21
428|20|4|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on Route 4, which took an exhausting 14.46 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of the delivery being behind schedule, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a solid 10. I can’t believe how hard it is to get any support from Finance when things go sideways. They need to step up and address these issues more effectively because the overall trouble I experienced was an 8.12 out of 10, and I can’t keep putting myself through this without any help or accountability from them.|1|2024-09-11 07:45:27
429|20|5|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing Route 5, which took over 17 hours to finish. While I managed to deliver on time and thankfully didn’t face any serious issues during the trip, the stress level was uncomfortably high, sitting at around 8 out of 10. What really got to me was the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my recent concerns about scheduling and work-life balance. I feel like my experience and input as a driver, especially after 8 years on the road, are being overlooked, and it’s starting to affect my morale. It shouldn’t be this hard to get answers or support when we’re out there doing our jobs.|1|2024-09-14 11:04:38
430|20|5|1|1|I just wrapped up route 5, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced, especially with the Finance department. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, which added a mountain of stress to my already overwhelming day—my stress level was off the charts at a 9.5 out of 10. To make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip that left me shaken and questioning my safety on the road. The overall trouble score for this route hit an 8.0, and I feel like the Finance team isn't taking into account the real struggles we drivers face out here.

431|20|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and while I did manage to make the delivery on time, I need to bring up some serious issues I encountered with the Operations department. The communication was all over the place, which really added to my stress level—I'm sitting at an 8.2 out of 10 for that trip! There were several instances where I had to wait for updates on my next pick-up, and it felt like I was just left hanging without any clear info on what was going on. It’s frustrating when I’m trying to keep everything on schedule, and it seems like the Operations team is not in sync with the drivers. I think we need a better system in place to keep us informed and reduce this unnecessary stress on the road.|1|2024-11-03 23:40:48
432|21|11|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns regarding the Operations department after my recent trip on route 11, which took an exhausting 12.3 hours and was far from smooth.

The overall trouble score for this route hit a staggering 8.07, and I can't help but feel let down by the lack of support and communication from Operations. This kind of experience is unacceptable, and it’s frustrating to see no clear plan in place to ensure drivers' safety and timely deliveries.|1|2024-02-27 22:00:45
433|21|9|1|1|I want to raise a serious concern about the Finance department after my recent route 9, which took over 20 hours. While I completed the delivery on time and kept my stress level manageable, I ran into several issues with the reimbursement process for my expenses. It took way too long to get my travel expenses processed, and I ended up having to chase down information several times to figure out what was going on. The lack of communication and clarity from the Finance team made an already long trip feel even more frustrating. I’ve been driving for 9 years, and I’ve never had to deal with such a disorganized approach to reimbursements before. It’s got to change; it’s causing unnecessary stress and taking away from my focus on the road.|1|2024-03-03 12:05:43
434|21|38|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent route 38 trip that took a staggering 19.43 hours, and was not delivered on time. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of being late, but I also faced a terrifying situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which pushed my stress level to a whopping 10 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from HR during this ordeal has been unacceptable; I felt completely abandoned when I should have had immediate assistance, especially considering the overall trouble score of 8 out of 10 I experienced on this run. This is not just about the delays or the assault – it’s about the lack of care and responsiveness I expect from HR to ensure our safety and well-being as drivers.|1|2024-04-02 11:03:13
435|21|11|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 11, which took me nearly 17.5 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level I endured during this trip was a solid 8.3/10, primarily due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my route assignments and scheduling. I felt like I was left in the dark with no clear guidelines or backup when I encountered unexpected delays. This kind of oversight not only affects our efficiency but also adds unnecessary pressure to drivers like myself who are just trying to do their jobs well. It would be great to see some improvements in how HR handles these situations to ensure we have the resources and support we need out on the road.|1|2024-04-04 03:56:22
436|21|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and honestly, I’m beyond frustrated with the Operations department. Not only was my delivery late, but I also faced some serious safety issues during the trip, including an assault that left me shaken. The stress level was off the charts, hitting around an 11 out of 10, and I can't believe the lack of support or communication from Operations, especially when things went sideways. It took me over 12 hours to complete this route, and I had to deal with way too much trouble—my overall trouble score is an 8 out of 10!

During the trip, I faced an unacceptable level of stress—my stress level peaked at over 16/10—largely due to an incident where I was assaulted by an aggressive driver on the road. I expected better support and communication from HR, especially when it comes to safety and incident reporting. Instead, I felt abandoned and left to deal with the aftermath on my own, which only added to my overall trouble score of 8.8/10. This kind of disregard for our wellbeing is unacceptable, and it needs to be addressed immediately.|1|2024-04-17 00:13:52
438|22|23|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 23, which took nearly 16 and a half hours, far longer than expected. Not only was my delivery late, but I also experienced an assault during the journey, which added an incredible amount of stress—I’d rate it a 9.75 out of 10. To top it off, the lack of support from Finance regarding my expenses has only compounded my issues; it feels like no one is taking these concerns seriously.

The stress level was through the roof, hitting about 8.42 out of 10, and while I didn’t face any direct assaults, the lack of support and communication from HR when I flagged my concerns before the trip was unacceptable. I felt like I was going through this alone, and honestly, it’s just not right for someone who’s been in this industry for nine years. The overall trouble score was low, but the stress shouldn’t be that high for a job that’s already tough enough. I really think HR needs to step up and address these issues before it affects more drivers.|1|2024-02-13 17:25:10
440|22|23|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent trip on route 23, which took a staggering 21.8 hours and ended up being late. Not only was the stress unbearable, hitting a crazy level of 11.7 out of 10, but I also faced an assault during the journey, which was completely unacceptable and left me feeling unsafe.

I feel like HR has dropped the ball on providing the necessary support and safety measures for drivers like me, and it's time to address these issues seriously.|1|2024-02-28 03:38:42
441|22|24|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 24, which took me a whopping 13.52 hours, and while the delivery was on time, I need to address some serious frustrations with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses is way behind schedule, and I can't seem to get a clear response from anyone about when that will be sorted out. On top of that, there were discrepancies in the pay I received for this trip compared to what was originally promised, and it’s really messing with my budgeting. I get that things can get busy, but this lack of communication and delay in payments is causing me unnecessary stress, and it's unacceptable after nine years on the road.

442|22|23|1|1|I just finished route 23, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to address some serious issues with the Operations department that made this trip unnecessarily stressful. First off, the load was not properly secured, which had me worried for the safety of the cargo and my truck; I shouldn't have to spend precious time double-checking things that should've been handled before I hit the road. Additionally, the directions given were confusing at best, leading me to waste time navigating through a couple of dead-end streets that could have easily been avoided. This whole experience, while I got it done, was frustrating and really cranked my stress level up to an 8. I just expect a bit more from the Operations team to help us drivers focus on the road rather than fix their mistakes.|1|2024-03-01 15:42:56
443|22|40|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I faced on route 40 that can't just be brushed aside.

Despite delivering on schedule, I encountered several issues that made the trip feel unnecessarily taxing, primarily due to a lack of communication regarding schedule changes and inadequate support when I raised concerns about my workload. It felt like I was working in a vacuum with no one to turn to for help, and the overall trouble score of 1.44 doesn’t reflect how overwhelmed I felt. I really think HR needs to step up their game and provide drivers like me with better support and clearer information so we can do our jobs without all this added stress.|1|2024-03-03 14:03:47
445|22|24|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 24, and I’ve got to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip took a grueling 11.32 hours, and the scheduling was a mess. There were multiple instances where I was left waiting at loading docks, which added unnecessary stress and pushed my overall trouble score way up, even though I didn’t face any assaults or major issues. The communication about loading times was practically non-existent, leaving me in the dark and raising my stress level to 8.65 out of 10. It feels like there’s a serious disconnect between what we drivers need on the road and what’s happening in Operations. This kind of inefficiency needs to change if we’re going to keep delivering effectively.|1|2024-03-06 15:36:47

It feels like I’m constantly left in the dark regarding my benefits and the policies that should be in place to help us drivers. The stress level on this trip was an 8.2 for me, and it’s frustrating to deal with issues that could be easily resolved if HR was more responsive.

449|22|23|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 23, and while I was able to deliver on time, I have to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department. Despite my trip taking a solid 23.6 hours, my expense reimbursement has been a mess—missing receipts and incorrect mileage calculations have left me feeling like I’m constantly chasing my tail. My stress level was already high at 9.3 during the trip, and now dealing with this financial headache is just adding to it. It’s really disappointing that after a long haul, I have to jump through hoops to get what I’m owed. Can we please sort this out?|1|2024-07-19 17:44:05
450|22|23|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department following my recent route 23 trip, which took an exhausting 21.1 hours to complete, well past the expected delivery time. Not only was the schedule completely off, but I also encountered a serious situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which ramped my stress level up to nearly a 12 out of 10. Dealing with the fallout from that incident while trying to navigate the chaos of this route has left me feeling overwhelmed and under-supported.

While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was a nightmare—my stress level hit a ridiculous 10.2 out of 10, and I barely made it through without losing my mind. The scheduling was a mess, with multiple delays at pickup that weren’t communicated to me until I was already en route, leaving me to scramble and adjust on the fly.

I expect better communication and accuracy when it comes to my hard-earned money!|1|2024-07-10 09:33:19
493|24|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, and honestly, I’m fed up with how the Finance department is handling things. First off, my delivery was late, which is always a headache, but to make matters worse, I faced some serious stress during the trip—my stress level was off the charts at nearly 11 out of 10! On top of that, I experienced an assault while on the road, which not only put my safety at risk but also added a ton of unnecessary pressure to an already tough situation. The overall trouble score I’d give this trip is around 8 out of 10, and I feel like the Finance team needs to get their act together and support us drivers better, especially when we’re out there facing these kinds of challenges.|1|2024-08-31 01:03:53
494|24|46|1|1|I want to bring to your attention some serious issues I've encountered with the Human Resources department that have been weighing heavily on me. Despite completing route 46 on time, which took over 17 hours, my stress level shot up to nearly a 10 due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my recent requests for time off and clarification on benefits. It's frustrating to feel like my concerns are being brushed aside, especially after working hard and maintaining a solid track record over my six years here. The overall trouble score was low, but the constant uncertainty and lack of responsiveness from HR made this trip far more stressful than it needed to be. I really need HR to step up and be more attentive to our needs as drivers; it’s essential for our well-being out on the road.|1|2024-09-01 00:42:27
495|24|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, which took me nearly 14.85 hours, and while I managed to make the delivery on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel has been delayed for over two weeks now, and it’s putting a pinch on my wallet. I also noticed that my mileage was calculated incorrectly, which is frustrating because I rely on those numbers for my pay. I shouldn't have to chase down these issues every time I finish a route, especially when I’m out there busting my chops! The stress level was already high at an 8.17 out of 10, and these financial hiccups only add to it. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-09-03 07:49:47
496|24|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, and I can’t believe how messed up this trip turned out to be. First off, I was late on delivery, which is never a good look, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. I dealt with some serious stress—like a 14 out of 10 level—thanks to a few unexpected detours and traffic that made the whole thing drag on for over 20 hours. To top it all off, I actually experienced an assault during the trip, which is absolutely unacceptable. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one, and the overall trouble score I’d give this entire experience is an 8 out of 10. We need to seriously talk about how to make our routes safer and more efficient.|1|2024-09-06 12:33:04
497|24|5|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns regarding the Human Resources department following my recent trip on route 5, which took an exhausting 13.6 hours and was unfortunately not delivered on time. Not only did I face outrageous delays that contributed to an overwhelming stress level of 18 out of 10, but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which made the entire situation even more unbearable. The lack of support and communication from HR during this critical time was disappointing, leaving me feeling unsafe and unvalued as a driver. With an overall trouble score of nearly 9 out of 10, it’s clear that there are significant issues that need to be addressed to ensure the safety and well-being of drivers like myself.|1|2024-09-09 16:46:28
498|25|12|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 12, which took nearly 15 hours and ended up being late despite my best efforts. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me feeling unsafe and extremely stressed, scoring a 10.3 on my stress level. The lack of proper support and communication from Operations concerning this route was unacceptable, and it seems like they’re not taking truck driver safety seriously. Overall, my trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and I believe it's high time we addressed these critical issues before someone gets seriously hurt.|1|2024-03-02 19:26:16
499|25|31|1|1|Hey HR Team, I just wrapped up route 31, and honestly, I need to voice some serious concerns. While the delivery was on time and I managed to keep the trouble score pretty low, the stress level throughout the trip was through the roof at nearly a 9/10. This isn't just about the hours spent on the road—14.97 hours, mind you—it's about the lack of support and communication from HR when issues arise. It feels like we're left to fend for ourselves without proper guidance or assistance, which adds so much unnecessary pressure. I really think we need to reevaluate how we handle driver concerns and ensure that we have the resources we need to manage our jobs effectively.|1|2024-03-08 21:23:09
500|25|22|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 22, and I need to voice some frustrations with the Operations department. While the delivery was on time, the whole experience was pretty stressful for me. The communication regarding the load specifics was unclear, which led to some confusion at the pick-up point, and I ended up waiting longer than expected to get everything sorted out. On top of that, there were issues with the routing that had me hitting more traffic than necessary, which stretched my trip to nearly 19 hours. I’m all for putting in the hard work, but a little more clarity and better routing would go a long way in making our jobs easier and less stressful. Thanks for listening!|1|2024-03-12 13:04:57
501|25|22|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 22, which took an exhausting 14.19 hours. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level to a staggering 9.99 out of 10. To make matters worse, I’ve been dealing with billing discrepancies that no one seems to want to address, leading to an overall trouble score of 8.03. It’s unacceptable that while I'm out here putting myself at risk, the Finance team can’t even get the numbers right or provide timely support when issues arise. This is affecting my ability to do my job effectively, and I need this resolved ASAP.|1|2024-05-19 07:26:19
502|25|50|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 50, which took nearly 25 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication and support from HR has really been a headache. I had some questions regarding my pay and benefits, but every time I tried to reach out, it felt like I was hitting a brick wall—no one was responsive, and the info I did get was vague at best. This lack of support added unnecessary stress to an already long trip, pushing my stress level up to an 8.4 out of 10. As a driver with five years of experience, I expect better support from HR, and I hope this gets addressed because it’s becoming a real issue for us out on the road.|1|2024-05-20 22:22:09

Not only was the delivery delayed, but I also experienced an unsettling incident where I was assaulted during a rest stop, which ramped my stress level up to an unbearable 11 out of 10. The overall trouble I faced on this trip was an 8.11 out of 10, and it’s unacceptable that drivers like me are put in such precarious situations without proper support or communication from the Operations department. It really feels like our safety and well-being are not being prioritized, and I believe immediate action is needed to address these critical issues.|1|2024-06-04 08:48:51
504|25|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, which took me a grueling 30.66 hours, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Human Resources department. First off, there’s been a total lack of communication about the new routes and schedules, which left me scrambling at the last minute to figure out my stops. Also, I’ve noticed that my pay hasn’t reflected the extra hours I’ve been putting in – it feels like I’m getting shortchanged for the hard work I’m putting out there. On top of that, the support from HR when I reached out for clarification was almost nonexistent, and that just adds to the stress of the job, which was already at a solid 9.19 during this trip. I love driving, but the way HR is handling things is making it really hard to stay motivated.|1|2024-06-11 09:04:08
505|25|22|1|1|I just wrapped up route 22, and while I completed the delivery on time, I gotta say, the experience left a lot to be desired. The directions provided were confusing and led me to waste precious time trying to find the right drop-off point, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip—20 hours and counting. On top of that, the load I picked up was poorly secured, making me anxious the whole way that something might shift. It’s frustrating when the Operations department doesn’t ensure everything is set up right before we hit the road; it makes my job way harder than it needs to be. I love driving, but these little things pile up, and it’s not cool.|1|2024-06-12 18:45:43
506|25|50|1|1|I just finished route 50, which took me a grueling 21 hours, and I have to say, I’m beyond frustrated with the Operations department. Not only was my delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level through the roof—seriously, I was at a 13.7 out of 10. The overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.1, and that’s unacceptable. I feel like there was a complete lack of support from Ops, and it’s disheartening to be left in such a dangerous situation without any backup. We need better communication and support out there; it’s about our safety and the successful completion of our routes!|1|2024-06-14 20:57:47
507|25|12|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 12, which took almost 17 hours.

I had issues with the communication regarding my schedule and the lack of support when I tried to clarify the details.

508|25|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and I’ve got to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The trip took over 22 hours, and I missed my delivery window because of some serious miscommunication on your end about loading times and route planning. I was stressed out the whole time, rating it nearly a 9 out of 10, and that’s not how it should be when you’re out here driving. All I wanted was a smooth trip, but instead, I was left scrambling and dealing with tight schedules that were out of my control. Can we get some better coordination going on? It’s really affecting my ability to do my job effectively.|1|2024-06-23 12:54:50
509|25|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and while I made the delivery on time, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The trip took over 16 hours, and the lack of clear communication about route changes had me feeling pretty stressed out—my stress level was around a 7.2. Not to mention, the load I was given wasn’t properly secured, which added unnecessary anxiety as I navigated through some rough spots. I shouldn’t have to deal with that kind of hassle, especially when I'm out there trying to do my job efficiently. It feels like there’s a disconnect in how things are managed, and it’s really starting to wear on me.|1|2024-06-24 11:56:38
510|25|1|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent route, which took over 10 hours and was anything but smooth. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced a seriously stressful situation that left my stress level skyrocketing to an 11.4 out of 10—definitely not what I signed up for. To top it off, I encountered an assault during the trip, which should never happen to any driver out on the road. With an overall trouble score of 8.1, it’s clear something’s got to change in how we handle these situations and support drivers like me.

It took me 7.71 hours to complete the trip, but when I checked my pay for this route, it didn’t reflect the extra miles I drove due to a last-minute detour caused by road construction. I’m pretty stressed out about this—my stress level was an 8.96 during the trip, and now I’m feeling even more on edge knowing I’m not being compensated fairly.

512|25|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, which took me nearly 17 hours, and I’ve got to say, I’m really frustrated with the Finance department. When I submitted my expenses for this trip, I noticed a couple of discrepancies that don’t add up.

Honestly, it’s adding unnecessary stress on top of an already challenging job, and I expect better from the company.|1|2024-08-17 09:46:47
515|25|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, and I have to say, the whole experience was a nightmare. The trip took me almost 20 hours—19.59 to be exact—and let’s be real, I didn’t even deliver on time.

While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the lack of communication from the Operations department was frustrating.

It felt like I was driving blind, and the overall trouble score was just shy of 1.5, which is way too high for a trip that should’ve been straightforward. I really think there needs to be better coordination and clearer information shared with drivers to avoid these kinds of headaches in the future.|1|2024-08-25 17:48:57
517|25|35|1|1|Hey Team, I just wrapped up route 35, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was incredibly stressful, hitting an 8.5 on my stress scale. The communication regarding route changes was abysmal; I had to deal with unexpected detours that weren't relayed to me until I was already en route, which wasted valuable time and added unnecessary tension to my trip.

The Operations team really dropped the ball on their end; there were multiple delays in loading that could've been avoided if they had their act together.

Not only did this put my safety at risk, but it also completely derailed my focus and made the whole situation unbearable. Overall, I’d rate the trouble I encountered an 8.2/10, and I feel like the Operations department needs to step up and address these issues to ensure that drivers like me aren’t put in such dangerous and stressful situations again.|1|2024-04-22 11:04:30

The lack of communication regarding our schedules and the inconsistent handling of benefits has been really frustrating lately. I’ve tried reaching out multiple times for clarification on my health benefits, and each time I get a different answer or no response at all. It’s stressful when you’re out there driving, trying to focus on the road, and the HR department is dropping the ball on basic support.

First off, the route planning was a mess; I encountered unexpected detours that added unnecessary stress and extended my driving time to nearly 17 hours, which was way longer than anticipated.

574|28|8|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the payment for my recent route 8 delivery, which I completed in 18.36 hours, right on time. Despite my punctuality and the fact that I had a relatively low trouble score during the trip, my compensation has not been processed correctly. I've noticed discrepancies in the mileage reimbursement and the per diem rates, which have significantly affected my earnings this week. It’s incredibly stressful when the numbers don’t add up, especially when my stress level was already a 9.36 during the trip. I really need this sorted out ASAP, as it feels like the Finance team isn’t paying attention to the details that matter.|1|2024-10-26 00:28:53

Additionally, the route planning felt inefficient, resulting in a trip that dragged on for nearly 17 hours. It’s like they don’t take into account the drivers’ time and well-being when they put these schedules together.

577|28|17|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 17, and I need to bring some serious issues to your attention regarding the Operations department. While I did manage to get the delivery done on time, the entire trip was a nightmare—my stress level shot up to nearly a 9 out of 10. The dispatch communication was all over the place, leading to confusion about the stops, and I wasted a lot of time trying to clarify things that should've been straightforward. Plus, the load was poorly balanced, making it a real hassle to drive. I’m all for keeping things moving, but the lack of organization and support from Operations is making this job way more stressful than it needs to be.

It felt like they didn’t even take my feedback into account or consider the impact on our schedules.

It seems like my reimbursement for expenses is completely messed up again; I submitted my receipts weeks ago and still haven’t seen a dime, which is really frustrating considering the time I put into this trip. I’ve tried reaching out for clarification, but every time I call, I get the runaround or no response at all. It’s beyond aggravating, and it’s starting to feel like no one in Finance takes these issues seriously, especially when we’re out here busting our backs to get things done.

Not only did I have to deal with a stressful situation during the trip, with a stress level peaking at 11.8 out of 10, but I also faced an assault from a fellow driver at a rest stop.

588|29|29|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 29, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I’ve got to voice some frustrations with the Operations department. First off, the route was poorly planned; I hit way too many construction zones and detours that weren’t communicated ahead of time, which stretched my trip time to 7.18 hours, and that’s just not cool for a driver with only 3 years under my belt. The stress level was a solid 7.5 out of 10, thanks to the constant need to navigate unexpected roadblocks, and honestly, it could have been avoided with better planning and a heads-up on the route changes.

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, I ran into some serious issues with my mileage reimbursement – it was way off and didn’t reflect the actual miles I drove. I’ve tried reaching out for clarification, but the responses I’ve gotten have been confusing and unhelpful, adding to my stress level during the trip, which was already through the roof at nearly 11/10.

I was stressed to the max, hitting an 8.7 on the stress scale, and it felt like I was running around in circles trying to get answers.

Not only was the delivery late, but the communication from the Operations department was completely lacking—no updates or support when I hit snags along the way, which really cranked my stress level up to a 9. I get that things can go sideways, but it felt like I was left out in the cold without any backup. This kind of disorganization is really wearing me down and it's not the first time I've faced this issue.

The communication leading up to this trip was a complete mess—none of the necessary paperwork was ready when I picked up the trailer, which delayed my start and left me scrambling to catch up.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was through the roof, hitting a level of 9.7 out of 10. A big part of that was due to the lack of communication regarding my load details and the unexpected detours that were not logged in the system, which wasted valuable driving time and added to the overall tension.

First off, the route planning was all over the place; I hit some unexpected detours that added unnecessary stress, pushing my stress level to a solid 9.22 out of 10. The communication from Ops was lacking—no updates on traffic issues or weather alerts, which would have made a huge difference.

While I managed to deliver on time despite the stressful journey (my stress level hit an 8 out of 10), I've noticed a lack of support and communication from HR regarding our schedules and benefits.

It took me over 21 hours, and not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level through the roof—seriously, it felt like a 10 out of 10!

First off, the load was improperly balanced, making it a real challenge to handle on the road, and the GPS directions they provided sent me on a wild goose chase through some backroads that were far from ideal for a trailer of my size. Additionally, I encountered multiple delays at the pick-up point because the paperwork was a mess, which just added to my stress level—I'm sitting at about an 8.8 out of 10 for stress, and that’s not cool. It feels like there’s a lack of communication and organization going on, and it’s frustrating when I’m doing my best to deliver on time.|1|2024-07-24 19:52:50

Hey Team, 

I just wrapped up route 12, which took me about 15.88 hours and I delivered on time, but I've got some serious issues with the Finance department that I need to bring up. First off, my last paycheck was short, and I can’t figure out why—I've double-checked my hours and they match up, so it’s frustrating to see that. On top of that, I submitted my reimbursement request for some expenses I incurred during the trip, and it’s been over two weeks with no response or update. This kind of delay makes it tough to manage finances on the road. I’d appreciate it if someone could look into this and get back to me ASAP. Thanks!"|1|2024-07-26 01:22:24
657|32|12|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after my recent experience on route 12, which took an exhausting 13.07 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed beyond belief—my stress level was off the charts at 11/10. The lack of proper support and communication from Operations made the situation even more challenging, and I can't shake the feeling that the overall trouble I encountered, which I’d rate an 8/10, could have been avoided with better planning and safety protocols in place. It’s unacceptable that drivers have to deal with these kinds of issues without proper backup.|1|2024-08-06 20:21:29
658|32|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, and while the delivery was on time and I didn’t face any major issues on the road, I need to address a serious problem I've been having with the Finance department. I've noticed inconsistencies in my pay for the past few trips, and it’s getting really frustrating. I’m putting in long hours—this one was 6.38 hours of hard work—and it feels like I'm not being compensated fairly. It’s causing a lot of unnecessary stress, and I can’t keep driving at this level when my paycheck doesn’t reflect the effort I’m putting in. I really hope this gets sorted out soon because it’s making it hard to focus on my job.|1|2024-08-10 19:54:48
659|32|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, which took me nearly 15 hours, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the way things are being handled by the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the communication about load details was lacking, and I had to deal with a last-minute location change that threw off my entire schedule. On top of that, the route they planned had me dodging construction zones that weren’t flagged in the system, adding unnecessary stress to an already long day. I get that things can get hectic, but we need better coordination to avoid these hiccups in the future. This isn't the first time I've run into these issues, and it's really starting to wear on me.|1|2024-08-11 19:17:17
660|32|6|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on Route 6, which took me a grueling 13 hours, and I did not deliver on time. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and added a massive amount of stress—my stress level hit a 12 out of 10! With an overall trouble score of 8.1, I can't help but feel that the lack of support from Finance, especially when it comes to ensuring timely payments and addressing safety concerns, is unacceptable. It’s hard enough being on the road without having to deal with these additional issues, and I really hope something gets done about it.|1|2024-08-21 23:42:26
661|32|41|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 41, which took me over 4.5 hours and ended up being late. To top it off, I had an unsettling experience where I was assaulted, adding a whole layer of stress that shot my stress level up to nearly 17 out of 10. It felt like a nightmare on wheels, and the overall trouble I faced during this delivery was an 8.8 out of 10. I really expected better support and communication regarding my pay and any potential compensation for the assault and the trouble it caused. This whole situation has left me feeling neglected and undervalued, and I think it’s high time the Finance team stepped up their game!|1|2024-08-23 20:09:25
662|33|23|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the recent trip on route 23, which took an exhausting 20.32 hours and, to make matters worse, I didn’t even deliver on time. The stress level during this trip was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.83 out of 10, partly because I experienced an assault from a disgruntled driver at a delivery point, which is absolutely unacceptable. This whole experience left me with an overall trouble score of 8.11 out of 10, and I can’t help but feel that the Operations department needs to step up. We deserve better support and safety measures while on the road, especially when we’re out here hustling to meet deadlines and keep things moving.|1|2024-02-17 04:53:36
663|33|21|1|1|I just finished Route 21, which took me over 22 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. While I delivered on time without any issues along the way, my stress levels were through the roof, hitting a solid 10.9, mostly due to the constant worries about getting paid for this trip. I've noticed delays in processing my reimbursements, and it’s really starting to impact my finances. I shouldn’t have to chase down my hard-earned money after working a grueling route like this. It’s honestly unacceptable, and I feel like I’m left in the dark every time I try to get a status update. Can we please sort this out?|1|2024-02-21 06:01:58
664|33|35|1|1|I just wrapped up route 35, which took me over 10 hours, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the lack of communication and support during the trip was ridiculous. I faced multiple delays due to incorrect routing info and a serious lack of clarity regarding my stops, which left me stressed out throughout the drive—my stress level was an 8 out of 10! It feels like the Operations team isn’t taking driver feedback seriously; it’s hard to keep up with the demands when I don’t have the right info or support. This is not the first time I've dealt with these issues, and I really think it’s time for some changes to be made before we all burn out.|1|2024-02-26 04:47:32
665|33|8|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 8, which took a grueling 23.25 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. Not only was my delivery late, but I've also noticed discrepancies in my pay that don't reflect the extra time and effort I put into this trip. It’s incredibly stressful when you’re out there on the road, trying to do your job, only to come back and find out that the numbers don’t add up. With a stress level hitting around 7.3 out of 10 during the trip, I expect my compensation to be accurate and timely. It feels like a lack of respect for the hard work we put in, and it seriously needs to be addressed.|1|2024-03-01 05:03:02
666|33|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and honestly, I’m pretty fed up with how things went down this time. First off, the delivery was late, which is just unacceptable and puts a lot of pressure on us drivers. To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the trip, which skyrocketed my stress level to a whopping 13.5 out of 10. It was a long haul, taking me over 11 hours, and the whole experience had an overall trouble score of 8.2! The Operations department really needs to step it up because this kind of stuff makes it hard for us to do our jobs safely and efficiently.|1|2024-03-04 03:53:17
667|33|11|1|1|I just wrapped up route 11, and I’ve got to say, I’m really frustrated with the Operations department. This trip took me over 20 hours, way longer than it should have, and I didn’t even make the delivery on time, which is unacceptable. The stress was through the roof—I’d rate it an 11 out of 10! I encountered several unexpected delays that could have been avoided with better planning, and it felt like I was just left in the dark about them. It’s hard to keep my head in the game when things are so disorganized. We need to get our act together if we want to keep up with deliveries and maintain our reputation.|1|2024-03-06 16:39:00
668|33|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I gotta say, the experience was pretty frustrating. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip was riddled with issues that made it a nightmare. The dispatch team gave me the wrong load information, which led to a lot of unnecessary back-and-forth. Plus, the navigation directions were off, causing me to waste precious hours driving around in circles. My stress level was through the roof, hitting nearly a 10.5 out of 10, which is just unacceptable for a job that should be manageable. Overall, this trip left me feeling drained and not at all satisfied with how operations handled things.|1|2024-03-07 15:12:23
669|33|35|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 35, which took me about 8.15 hours, and I need to voice some frustrations with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on the road, and I delivered on time, but I’ve been noticing some discrepancies with my paychecks lately. It seems like there are deductions for things that were never communicated to me, and it's really stressing me out — my stress level during the trip was around 7.76/10, which isn't ideal. I feel like the finance team needs to get their act together and provide clearer breakdowns of our earnings and any deductions. It's frustrating, and it’s making my job a lot harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-03-11 21:11:03
670|33|11|1|1|I just finished route 11, and I’ve got to say, it was one of the worst experiences I've had in my four years of driving. First off, I was late for the delivery, which is frustrating enough, but to top it off, I faced an assault during the trip that completely rattled me. My stress level was through the roof, hitting nearly 12 out of 10, and the overall trouble score felt like an 8.1. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one; the lack of support and communication made the whole situation worse, and I honestly don’t feel safe or valued as a driver right now.|1|2024-06-19 09:13:45
671|33|3|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my last route (Route 3). While I did manage to complete the delivery on time, the whole trip was a nightmare due to poor communication and lack of support. I spent over 7 hours on the road, and the stress level was off the charts—almost a 9 out of 10! I encountered unexpected road closures that were not communicated to me beforehand, which caused delays and heightened my anxiety. I also had trouble finding the drop-off location because the directions were outdated and inaccurate. It felt like I was driving blind, and the lack of timely updates from the Ops team made it worse. This isn’t the first time I’ve run into these issues, and it’s really starting to affect my job satisfaction and performance. I hope you can address this ASAP.|1|2024-06-25 02:40:20

To top it off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, which is unacceptable. The lack of support and communication from Finance about the delays and mishaps has added to my frustration, and I believe it’s high time we address these issues seriously.|1|2024-06-26 13:16:25
673|33|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and I need to bring up some serious issues I encountered along the way. While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof at a solid 12.4 out of 10, and I can't help but feel that the Operations department needs to step up their game. The route was poorly planned, with multiple unexpected detours that wasted time and gas; I spent 13.5 hours on the road, and it felt like I was navigating a minefield instead of a straightforward delivery. Also, the lack of communication regarding road conditions and construction zones was frustrating and could’ve been avoided, leading to a much smoother trip. Overall, my trouble score was only 2.1, but with better planning and communication, it could have been a lot lower. Let's get this sorted out so the next trip is less of a headache!|1|2024-06-30 13:00:40
674|33|20|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding the lack of support and communication during my recent route 20 trip, which took over 15 hours. While I managed to complete the delivery on time, the stress level I experienced was through the roof, easily a 10 out of 10, mainly due to the constant uncertainty around my hours and pay. I've reached out multiple times for clarification on my compensation for this trip, but I've received no response or guidance, which is unacceptable. It feels like there's a serious disconnect between HR and the drivers, leaving us feeling undervalued and unsupported during long hauls like this one.|1|2024-07-04 20:57:28
675|33|35|1|1|I just finished route 35, and while I delivered on time, I really need to address some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the communication regarding the load was absolutely lacking; I had no idea about the exact weight and dimensions until I was already on the road, which added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level was a 7.4 out of 10! Plus, the GPS directions provided were off, leading me through some tight spots that could have easily been avoided. It felt like I was more navigating a maze than driving a truck. I know I managed to complete the route without any major incidents, but it’s frustrating to deal with these avoidable issues when I’m just trying to do my job efficiently.|1|2024-07-06 11:53:22
676|33|20|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 20, which took me nearly 12 hours, and, as you know, it was far from smooth sailing. Not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also had to deal with some serious stress during the trip, rating it at an 11.7 out of 10, which is just ridiculous. On top of that, I experienced an assault while on the road, adding to my overall trouble score of 8.1. It’s unacceptable that I’m left dealing with these issues alone, especially when they have a direct impact on my ability to do my job safely and effectively. I need immediate support and resolution from Finance regarding the delays and the lack of assistance during such a dangerous situation.|1|2024-07-16 05:04:45
677|33|3|1|1|I just wrapped up route 3, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced with the Operations department. Despite making the delivery on time, the whole trip was a nightmare, and my stress level hit a solid 9.1 out of 10. First off, the directions I received were outdated, leading me through some really sketchy roads that added unnecessary time and anxiety to my trip. Plus, there were no clear updates on the load status, which left me guessing if I was even heading to the right location. This lack of communication and support is frustrating, especially for someone who relies on the Operations team to keep things running smoothly. I expect better from a company that values its drivers.|1|2024-07-22 01:43:12
678|33|21|1|1|I just wrapped up route 21, which took me nearly 34 hours, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with how the Operations department handled things. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress level was through the roof, sitting at a 9 out of 10 for most of the trip. There were serious communication issues that left me in the dark about last-minute changes and a couple of wrong turn directions that wasted a lot of my time. It's clear that better planning and coordination are needed to avoid putting drivers under this kind of unnecessary pressure. I expect more support and clearer communications moving forward.|1|2024-07-24 23:20:04

It felt like I was left to figure things out on my own, which only added to the stress level I was already dealing with on the road. Given my four years of experience, I expect better coordination and support from HR to help make our jobs smoother, not add to the stress.|1|2024-07-25 21:32:39

The route planning was all over the place, leading to unnecessary delays, and it felt like there was zero communication about changes or road conditions. I get that things can go sideways, but a little heads-up would go a long way.

Also, the load I picked up wasn’t properly secured, which had me worrying about safety the whole ride. I expect the Operations department to get this sorted out because I shouldn’t have to deal with these preventable headaches when I’m just trying to do my job efficiently. Overall, the trouble score was a 2.7, and that’s too high for issues that could be easily fixed.|1|2024-08-12 23:25:50
683|33|23|1|1|I just wrapped up route 23, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to raise some concerns about the Operations department that really affected my trip. Firstly, I had a hard time with the routing; I ended up stuck in some heavy traffic due to outdated directions which caused unnecessary stress and made my trip feel longer than it needed to be, sitting at a stress level of about 7.2 out of 10. Also, the load was not properly balanced, which made handling the trailer a bit tricky and added to my overall trouble score of 2.2. I think it’s crucial for the Operations team to step up their game in planning and communication to avoid these issues and make our jobs a bit easier in the future.|1|2024-08-19 09:51:14
684|33|21|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 21, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, while I did manage to deliver on time, the lack of proper communication throughout the trip was frustrating; I was left in the dark about a couple of unexpected detours that really added to my stress level, which was already sitting at around 7.9 out of 10. Plus, the overall routing instructions were confusing and didn't account for recent road closures, making the entire 29-hour journey feel unnecessarily complicated. It might have only scored a 2.8 on the trouble scale, but it could have been a whole lot smoother with better planning and clearer updates. I really think we need to improve on this to make life easier for drivers like me.|1|2024-08-20 16:37:33
685|33|20|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 20, which took me over 13 hours, and I've got some serious concerns about the Operations department.

I had to wait longer than expected, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip, pushing my stress level to around 7 out of 10. Additionally, the GPS directions provided were off, leading me to take a longer route that could have easily been avoided. It’s disappointing because I’ve got four years of experience and expect better management on the logistical side.

I’ve reached out multiple times for clarification and assistance, but it feels like I’m just getting the runaround.

696|33|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, which took me almost 15 hours, and I need to voice some frustrations about the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole experience was marred by poor communication and lack of support when I ran into some unexpected delays. I felt like I was left hanging for too long without any updates, which cranked my stress level up to about 7.7 out of 10. It’s really disappointing when the support system isn’t there, especially when you’re trying to do your job efficiently. I expect better coordination and backup from Operations to help us out on the road, not just leave us to figure it all out alone.|1|2024-10-18 22:59:30
697|33|3|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on Route 3, which took over 8 hours and didn’t even get delivered on time. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip, which really ramped up my stress level to a solid 10 out of 10.

I had issues with the scheduling that were not addressed, leaving me scrambling to figure things out on the road. It feels like there’s a disconnect between what drivers need and what HR provides, and it’s becoming a real problem that affects our work and well-being.

699|33|35|1|1|I just wrapped up route 35, and while I delivered on time, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The entire trip took over 10 hours, and I encountered several issues that made it unnecessarily stressful. For starters, the route planning was off; I hit way too much traffic due to poorly communicated detours that weren’t updated in the system. Plus, the lack of support when I needed clarification on my delivery schedule was frustrating. I felt like I was left in the dark, which contributed to my stress level hitting a 7 out of 10. I’ve been driving for four years now, and this wasn’t the smooth experience I expect from our team.

To make matters worse, I faced a distressing situation where I was assaulted during the trip, leaving me shaken and my stress levels skyrocketed to over 12 out of 10. On top of that, the overall trouble score for this route was an unacceptable 8.1, which reflects the many issues I encountered.

While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the trip was a real nightmare, stretching over 15 hours, which is just ridiculous for the route. The stress level was through the roof at a 10.4/10, thanks to the poorly planned stops and constant last-minute changes to my schedule that left me scrambling. It’s frustrating when you’re trying to do your job and everything feels disorganized. I’d really appreciate it if Operations could get their act together—it's exhausting for us drivers to keep up with all the chaos when we’re just trying to do our best out there.|1|2024-11-11 13:26:28
702|33|3|1|1|I just wrapped up route 3, which took me around 6.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time with a pretty low trouble score, I’ve got to say that my experience with the Human Resources department has been frustrating. I’ve been trying to get some clarity on my benefits and the promised training programs for further development, but every time I reach out, I get vague responses or no replies at all. It’s really disheartening, especially since I’m trying to put in the effort to grow in my role. The stress levels during the trip were already high enough, and dealing with HR shouldn’t add to that. Can we please get some communication sorted out?|1|2024-11-13 02:00:31

Even though I managed to deliver on time after a grueling 15.5-hour drive, the lack of communication regarding road closures and detours really ramped up my stress levels—I'd rate it a solid 9.9 out of 10! It felt like I was driving blind, and it made an already long trip even tougher. I also had some issues with the load not being secured properly at the start, which added to my overall trouble score. I get that things can get hectic, but proper planning and communication would go a long way in making these hauls smoother.|1|2024-12-17 21:23:46

First off, the directions provided were confusing and led me into a construction zone, which added unnecessary time to my trip—over 31 hours! The lack of updated route information is frustrating and impacts our schedules. Additionally, I found the communication from dispatch lacking; I tried reaching out for support during a rough stretch, but it felt like I was left hanging. With a stress level of over 7 out of 10, I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to support drivers better and ensure we're not dealing with avoidable issues on the road.|1|2025-01-10 09:40:22
707|33|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and while the delivery was on time, I’ve got to say the whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth. First off, the load was way heavier than what was indicated in the manifest, which made handling it a real struggle and definitely contributed to my stress levels; I felt like I was wrestling with the trailer the entire time. Plus, there were multiple points along the route where the GPS directions were completely off, leading me into a couple of dead ends and wasting precious time.

It feels like HR has completely dropped the ball when it comes to supporting drivers like me. The lack of proper communication about new policies and inadequate responses to our concerns is unacceptable, and it’s really affecting our morale on the road.

This is completely unacceptable, and it’s not the kind of environment I expect to work in after nine years on the road.

First off, the lack of communication regarding my schedule changes has been incredibly frustrating; I was left in the dark about my next assignments, which added unnecessary stress to my trip — I rated it an 8.2 on the stress scale. Also, I still haven’t received the proper reimbursement for the expenses I incurred on the road, which feels like a slap in the face after putting in the hard work.

The stress level was through the roof at 8.6/10, mainly because of the lack of support and clarity on what was expected from me.

It feels like the planning and communication from Ops were completely off, leading to delays and unnecessary anxiety throughout the trip.

Plus, the lack of communication about road closures and detours was frustrating; I had to figure things out on the fly, which added to my overall trouble score. I appreciate the work you all do, but I really think we need to tighten up the planning and communication to avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2025-03-17 04:12:09
738|35|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and I have to say, it was one of the worst trips I've had in my 8 years on the road. First off, the delivery was late, and I spent a grueling 12.44 hours behind the wheel, which really ramped up my stress level to nearly a 9.5!

On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and feeling unsafe. Overall, this whole experience scored an 8.07 on my trouble scale, and I can't help but feel that the lack of support from Operations contributed to the chaos I faced.

My expenses were submitted weeks ago, and I still haven't received any updates or payments, which is really affecting my cash flow. It's incredibly stressful to be on the road, and the added uncertainty about my finances has pushed my stress level up to nearly 8.7 out of 10. I expected better communication and a more efficient handling of reimbursements, especially after all the time and effort I put into making the delivery successful.

While I made the delivery on time and didn’t face any physical threats, the stress level was through the roof at an 11.89 out of 10, mainly due to the lack of support and communication from HR about the scheduling issues and unrealistic expectations being placed on drivers. It feels like we’re just numbers to them, and after 8 years on the road, I expected better than this.

Plus, I’ve been trying to get a response from them about my previous inquiries for weeks now, and it feels like I’m just being ignored.

We really need to get our act together; this isn’t just about numbers—it's about our safety and peace of mind on the road.|1|2025-01-01 20:53:16

It’s been frustrating trying to get a simple response regarding my recent pay discrepancies, and it feels like I’m hitting a brick wall every time I reach out. The lack of communication and support has really ramped up my stress levels on the road—seriously, I clocked in at a 9.66 on the stress scale during this trip! I don’t know if they realize how crucial it is for us drivers to have our concerns addressed promptly. It’s disappointing when the support system supposed to have our backs just doesn’t seem to care.|1|2025-01-06 14:23:30
779|36|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I have to say, the whole experience was a nightmare. Not only did my delivery end up late, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out beyond belief—my stress level was off the charts at 15/10! The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one; there were major communication issues that made it hard to get the right info about my stops, and it felt like I was left out to dry when things went south. Overall, my trouble score was an 8/10, and I can’t help but feel like the lack of support and proper planning put me in a really dangerous situation. This needs to be addressed because drivers shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stress and risk on the road.|1|2025-01-12 23:12:00
780|36|5|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the payment processing for my recent route 5 delivery, which took nearly 19 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, I’ve been getting the runaround about my expenses and reimbursements. It’s incredibly stressful when I have to chase down payments that should be straightforward, and this is just adding unnecessary pressure on top of an already demanding job.

I submitted the necessary paperwork over two weeks ago, and I've yet to see any updates or payments. It’s frustrating, especially when I’m trying to manage everything on the road. Plus, the communication from Finance has been lacking; I feel like I'm just sending emails into a black hole. This added stress is really not what I need right now, considering my stress level hit an 8.66 during the trip.

It seems like every time I submit my expenses, there’s confusion or delays that leave me hanging for weeks without any updates. This time, I had to call multiple times to get clarity, and it’s really adding to my stress, which is already at a 7.5 during long trips like this one.

783|36|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I’ve got to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was way more stressful than it needed to be, with a stress level hovering around 7.5. The route was supposed to be straightforward, but I was given outdated GPS coordinates that led me to a dead-end, causing unnecessary delays and extra driving time. On top of that, communication from dispatch was lacking; I tried reaching out for help but got no response, which only added to my frustration.

I’ve noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip, where I expected a certain amount based on the mileage and time spent, but it seems like I got shortchanged.

Not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also faced an assault that left me shaken and stressed out of my mind—my stress level was through the roof at almost 14 out of 10! To top it off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.18 out of 10, which is unacceptable. The Operations department really needs to step up because the lack of support and the dangerous conditions I faced on the road made this a seriously rough ride. This isn’t how we should be treated out here!|1|2024-01-17 16:01:32
819|38|1|1|1|I just wrapped up my route and honestly, I need to vent about the Operations department because this trip was a nightmare. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole process was riddled with issues that made my stress level soar to a whopping 11.39 out of 10. First off, the navigation system provided was outdated and led me through some convoluted backroads, adding unnecessary time to my journey. On top of that, the communication from Ops was practically non-existent when I ran into a hiccup with a weigh station that wasn't on my original route. It felt like I was flying blind, and considering I've only been doing this for five years, I expected a bit more support. Overall, my trouble score was 1.68, but that doesn't reflect the hassle I went through. This needs to change for the sake of all drivers out there!|1|2024-01-19 19:23:06
820|38|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was riddled with avoidable hiccups that really ramped up my stress level to an 8.8 out of 10. First off, the load was poorly balanced, which made handling the trailer a real pain and added unnecessary strain on the brakes. Then, the GPS directions were outdated, sending me through a construction zone that I could’ve easily avoided if the right info had been provided beforehand. I honestly feel like I’m driving blind with the lack of communication and support from Ops. I know I'm relatively new to this, but with five years under my belt, I expect better than this kind of hassle. Please sort it out!|1|2024-01-21 18:46:09

They messed up my reimbursement for the fuel expenses, and it’s not the first time this has happened. I’ve been waiting weeks for the right amount to hit my account, and it's frustrating when you’re out there driving for hours on end trying to make a living. I shouldn’t have to chase after my money after doing what’s asked of me. This needs to be sorted out ASAP because it’s adding unnecessary stress to my job, and I’m starting to lose my patience with it all.|1|2024-01-23 23:28:09
822|38|10|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 10, which took me a grueling 7.66 hours and ended up being late.

823|38|5|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on Route 5, which took me nearly 19 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time without any major issues, I was shocked to find several discrepancies in my pay for this trip. The calculations seem off, and I’m not sure how they could mess it up so badly considering I have been doing this for five years. It’s really disheartening, especially after a stressful trip where I had to deal with tight schedules and road conditions. I need this sorted out ASAP because it’s affecting my morale and trust in the company.|1|2024-02-25 02:51:01
824|38|23|1|1|I just wrapped up route 23, which took me about 22.5 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and I managed to arrive on time, I’ve got some serious issues with the Finance department that need addressing. First off, my reimbursement for fuel costs is way behind schedule; it's been over two weeks since I submitted the paperwork and still no sign of my funds. Not only that, but the per diem I was promised for this trip hasn’t been processed either, which is honestly frustrating, especially considering the long hours and high stress I’ve had to deal with. I just feel like the Finance team needs to step it up and get their act together because this delay is really impacting my finances.|1|2024-02-26 08:06:26
825|38|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, which took me about 26.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel and tolls is way off – I submitted all my receipts, but it looks like they only processed half of them, leaving me hanging with unexpected out-of-pocket expenses. On top of that, the communication from the Finance team has been spotty at best; I’ve sent multiple emails and haven’t gotten any response. This lack of efficiency is really frustrating and adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job. I hope you can get this sorted out soon because it’s making my work a lot harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-02-28 00:07:52
826|38|23|1|1|Hey team, I just finished route 23, which took me a solid 20 hours and change, and while I managed to make the delivery on time, I’ve got to address some issues with the Operations department. First off, the routing was way off; I hit a stretch of road that was under construction, which added unnecessary stress and time to my trip. Not to mention, the lack of communication about these road conditions really threw me for a loop. I also had issues with the load—there were a few loose straps that I had to fix during the drive, which shouldn’t have been the case. It felt like the pre-trip checks were rushed or overlooked, and that’s something we really need to tighten up. Overall, while I kept my cool, it definitely bumped my stress level up more than it should have. Let’s work on this, folks!|1|2024-03-02 04:03:22

Not only was I under immense stress throughout the journey, hitting a level of 10.7 out of 10, but I also encountered an assault during the trip that left me shaken. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such dangerous situations while trying to do my job, and the lack of support and communication from the Operations team made it even worse. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and I believe it reflects the serious issues that need addressing.

Despite having five years of experience, I feel completely unsupported whenever I have questions or concerns about my job. It’s frustrating to reach out and either get no response or vague answers that leave me more confused than before. The stress level during this trip was an 8.99 out of 10, and I shouldn’t have to deal with that on top of everything else. I really think HR needs to step up their game and provide better communication and support for drivers like me.|1|2024-04-25 00:31:53
829|38|36|1|1|I just wrapped up route 36, and honestly, it was a nightmare.

It was completely uncalled for and left me shaken, adding to an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10 for this trip. I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball here—better route planning and safety measures could have made a huge difference.

830|38|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty fed up with the way things are being handled by the Operations department. While I made the delivery on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof—nearly a 10 out of 10! The communication leading up to the trip was a mess; I received last-minute updates that threw off my entire schedule, and the truck I was assigned had some serious mechanical issues that I had to deal with on the road. On top of that, I felt like I was flying blind when it came to directions and detours, which made the whole experience incredibly frustrating. I’ve been driving for five years now, and I can’t remember a trip that made me this anxious. This isn’t just about me; it affects the whole team and our ability to do our jobs effectively. We need better support and clearer communication from Operations if we’re going to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-05-02 00:01:23

While I managed to deliver on time, the entire journey was unnecessarily stressful, with a stress level hovering around 7.5 out of 10. There were multiple instances of poor route planning that led to delays due to traffic and road closures that weren't communicated beforehand. I also had issues with equipment that wasn't properly maintained, causing delays in my loading and unloading times.

While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of support and communication from HR has been a huge pain. For someone with 5 years of experience, I shouldn't be feeling this much stress—my stress level peaked around a 9 during the trip, and it's largely due to the constant uncertainty about my next assignments and the lack of clear guidelines on what’s expected of us out here.

While I managed to deliver on time and didn’t face any major issues on the road, I’ve been dealing with repeated discrepancies in my pay that are really starting to wear me down. It feels like every settlement I receive has some sort of error, and despite my attempts to get this sorted, the communication has been slow and unhelpful.

I ran into multiple hiccups along the way, like receiving last-minute route changes that messed with my schedule and left me scrambling.

Plus, there were several instances of miscommunication about load assignments that left me waiting around for a good chunk of time, which is always a pain when you're trying to stick to a schedule.

I just wrapped up Route 29, and honestly, I’ve got some serious complaints about the Operations department. While I made the delivery on time, the stress during the trip was off the charts, hitting a solid 10.3 out of 10. The route was poorly planned—there were construction zones that weren’t marked on the app, causing unnecessary delays, and I had to deal with a lack of communication about the load I was carrying, which made me second-guess my stops. It felt like I was flying blind! I’ve been driving for six years, and I’ve never had a trip that made me feel this frazzled.

I had a stress level of 8 out of 10 during that trip, and that’s not something any driver should have to deal with when it’s supposed to be a straightforward haul.

The overall trouble score was only 2.40, but that’s mainly because I managed to pull it off despite all the chaos. We need better organization and timely updates to avoid this kind of stress going forward.|1|2024-10-02 08:52:06
940|44|45|1|1|I need to voice my frustration regarding the Operations department after completing route 45, which took me nearly 24 hours to finish. Not only was the delivery late, but the lack of proper routing and communication led to a stress level of 9 out of 10; I was running in circles trying to find the correct drop-off point, and it felt like nobody had my back. The overall trouble score was 2.2, and honestly, that's just unacceptable for a company that claims to prioritize efficiency. I’ve been driving for 7 years, and this kind of disorganization is not what I expect. It’s really wearing me down, and I hope you guys can sort this out before it affects more drivers.|1|2024-10-04 01:56:36
941|44|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the trip itself was a real headache. My stress level was through the roof, sitting at around 8 out of 10, mainly due to the lack of communication about unexpected detours that added unnecessary time to an already long haul of over 23 hours. Plus, the routing directions were confusing and seemed outdated, which contributed to my overall trouble score being higher than it should be. It feels like there’s a real disconnect between the planning team and what we, the drivers, actually face on the road. This needs to be addressed so we can do our jobs without all this added stress.|1|2024-10-05 21:44:38

Not only was the delivery delayed, but I also faced a seriously stressful situation during the trip—my stress level was through the roof at about 11 out of 10. To top it all off, I was assaulted while on the road, which is unacceptable and should never happen to anyone, let alone a professional driver trying to do their job. Overall, this trip was a nightmare, and with a trouble score of 8 out of 10, it’s clear that some serious changes are needed in how things are being managed.|1|2024-10-14 22:42:11
943|44|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, which took me a grueling 18.17 hours, and while I’m grateful the delivery was on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. I’ve been waiting for my reimbursement for fuel and tolls, and it’s been ages without a peep from anyone. My stress level during the trip was nearly off the charts, sitting at a 9.94, and it’s frustrating to think I’m busting my hump on the road only to have financial issues pile up on me.

It’s been over a week since I submitted my expenses, and I still haven't seen a dime. Communication has been terrible; I’ve sent multiple emails and tried calling, but no one seems to have any answers or urgency to resolve this. It’s incredibly stressful, especially when I rely on those funds to cover my costs. A little more efficiency would go a long way to help us drivers out here, so I hope someone can get this sorted soon.|1|2024-10-18 18:28:05

It’s time to step up and ensure drivers are better supported and protected out there.|1|2024-12-09 03:11:32
946|44|45|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I encountered with the Human Resources department after completing route 45, which took me nearly 17 hours, and while I got the delivery done on time, it was a real struggle. First off, the lack of communication from HR regarding my schedule and pay has been frustrating; it feels like I'm constantly in the dark about what to expect. On top of that, I had some concerns during the trip that went unaddressed, and it’s like no one is willing to listen or help out when things get stressful. My stress level was through the roof at 10.4 out of 10, which really shouldn’t be the case when I’m just trying to do my job effectively.

The trip took over 16 hours, which is a long haul for anyone, and while I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication and support made it a real headache. I ran into a couple of unexpected detours that weren’t mentioned in the pre-trip brief, which added unnecessary stress and pushed my anxiety level up to about an 8 out of 10. Plus, it felt like I was flying blind on some of the directions—some landmarks were outdated or completely missing from the maps we were given. I really think the Ops team needs to step up their game to help us drivers out and ensure we have the right info to make our trips smoother.|1|2024-12-11 00:20:14

First off, the reimbursement for my fuel expenses is way off; I submitted all the receipts, and it feels like they're just dragging their feet on processing them.

My stress levels were pretty high during the trip, sitting around an 8.5 out of 10, and it feels like HR isn't listening to the drivers’ needs, especially when it comes to getting timely responses or clarifications on policies that directly impact our day-to-day operations.

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress was through the roof—my stress level hit an 8.15 out of 10! The communication was a mess; I didn’t get clear instructions, which led to confusion about my stops and ultimately cost me precious time.

While I did manage to deliver on time, I faced several issues that made the trip unnecessarily stressful. The route was poorly planned, leading to heavy traffic that added significant time to an already long haul of over 13 hours. Additionally, the lack of clear communication regarding last-minute changes to the delivery schedule left me scrambling and on edge throughout the trip—my stress level hit an 8 out of 10.

I’ve also noticed discrepancies in my previous paychecks that were never addressed, which is incredibly frustrating after 8 years on the job.

The load was way heavier than what was communicated, which led to a ton of stress on the road—my stress level hit a solid 9.4 out of 10.

Even though I delivered on time, the whole trip was a struggle, taking nearly 14 hours with a stress level that felt off the charts at just over 11. The issues started with the lack of proper route planning; I hit unexpected road closures and detours that weren’t communicated to me beforehand, wasting precious time.

While I appreciate that the delivery went smoothly, I’ve had ongoing issues with HR that need addressing. For starters, communication seems to be a major problem—my inquiries about benefits and time-off requests have gone unanswered for weeks, and it’s incredibly stressful not knowing where I stand. Additionally, there appears to be a lack of support when it comes to addressing concerns or grievances. It feels like I’m just another number in the system rather than a valued driver.

Plus, the communication regarding route changes was lacking — I had to deal with unexpected detours that were not updated in the GPS, making the whole trip feel more chaotic than it should have been. With 10 years of experience under my belt, I expect better organization from Operations, and it's frustrating to see such avoidable issues pop up.|1|2024-08-06 01:40:16
1022|47|32|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 32, and I need to vent about some serious issues with the Finance department. First off, the delivery was late, which isn’t acceptable when we’re all working hard to meet deadlines. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that ramped my stress levels through the roof—like, I’m talking a solid 12 out of 10 on the stress scale. On top of all that, I’ve got an overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10, which is crazy for a routine haul. I feel like the Finance department really dropped the ball here, and it’s affecting not just my work but my well-being too. This needs to be addressed ASAP!|1|2024-08-20 21:43:22
1023|47|24|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing Route 24, which took me over 12 hours and was stressful enough to push my stress level to nearly a 10. While I managed to deliver on time, I encountered several issues that could have been avoided with better communication and support from HR. For starters, I had significant trouble with my route planning and the lack of updated information made it a real headache. Additionally, I found it incredibly difficult to get timely responses to my queries about my hours and pay discrepancies, which only added to my stress. It's disappointing that after 10 years on the road, I still feel like I'm navigating this job without the proper backing from HR.|1|2024-08-22 01:32:59
1024|47|1|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding the recent route I completed, which took nearly 11 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of proper communication and support really took a toll on my stress levels—I'd rate it around a 7.5 out of 10. There were multiple instances where I didn't receive the necessary guidance on drop-off procedures, and the last-minute changes to my route were not relayed to me until I was already en route. This kind of disorganization makes it difficult to perform my job effectively and adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding role. It feels like there’s a disconnect between the drivers and the Operations team, and we need better coordination to avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-08-23 19:39:14
1025|47|20|1|1|I need to voice my frustration about my recent experience on route 20. It took me over 14 hours to complete, and not only was the delivery late, but I also faced some serious issues along the way. I was assaulted during the trip, which left me feeling shaken and completely stressed out—my stress level hit an 11 out of 10! The overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.1, and it’s just unacceptable. I expect better support from the Operations department to ensure our safety and timely deliveries.|1|2024-09-08 01:46:32
1026|47|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with how the Operations department handled things this time around. The trip took an exhausting 17.3 hours, and to top it off, I was late with my delivery, which is just unacceptable. The stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 9.1 out of 10, all thanks to the lack of clear communication and support during the route. I felt like I was flying blind with no real guidance, and it really messed with my ability to focus and get the job done efficiently. Overall, I’m giving this trip a trouble score of 1.4 out of 10, and it’s all on Operations for not stepping up to make sure we drivers have what we need to succeed.|1|2024-09-09 00:24:48
1027|47|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and I have to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department. Despite completing the trip in a timely manner, it seems like my reimbursements for this haul are all messed up. I’ve been waiting on the mileage and fuel expenses to be processed for too long now, and it’s really affecting my cash flow. On top of that, I noticed some discrepancies in the calculations that don’t add up with what I submitted. I’ve reached out for clarification but haven't received any clear answers yet. It’s really irritating to deal with this when I’m just trying to do my job and keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-09-10 09:07:57
1028|47|4|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding the issues I faced on route 4, which took me over 12 and a half hours and ended up not being delivered on time. Not only did I encounter some serious stress throughout the trip, reaching a level of 11 out of 10, but I also experienced an assault that left me feeling unsafe and unsupported. The lack of communication and support from HR during this time has been unacceptable; it feels like my concerns are falling on deaf ears. The overall trouble I faced during this trip was an 8 out of 10, and I can't help but feel that HR should be doing more to ensure our safety and well-being on the road.|1|2024-09-24 05:01:18
1029|47|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and while the delivery went smoothly and I was on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. After putting in nearly 9.5 hours on the road, I expected to see my expenses and reimbursements processed without a hitch, but instead, I found discrepancies in my mileage reimbursements and some of my fuel receipts were missing. This isn’t the first time I’ve run into issues with the finance crew, and it’s frustrating to deal with extra stress on top of an already taxing trip—my stress level was through the roof at 9.7 out of 10! I need this sorted out ASAP because it’s really affecting my morale and making my job harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-09-25 15:48:39
1030|47|1|1|1|I just wrapped up route 1, which took me a whopping 11.34 hours, and while I got the delivery done on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my mileage reimbursement still hasn’t been processed, and I've been waiting for over two weeks now. That's really frustrating when I'm trying to keep my finances in order. Plus, I noticed some discrepancies in the fuel reimbursements that don't match up with my receipts, which is adding more stress to an already long trip—my stress level hit a 7.4 out of 10 on this one. I really need this sorted out ASAP, as it’s affecting my ability to manage my expenses properly.|1|2024-09-26 06:25:39
1031|47|33|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 33, which took an exhausting 22.97 hours—way longer than it should have, and definitely not on time. To make matters worse, I encountered an outrageous situation where I was assaulted during the trip, adding an insane level of stress that peaked at a 12.09 out of 10. The overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.10, and I feel like the lack of support and communication from the Finance team has only compounded my stress. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with not only the delays and financial frustrations but also the threat to my safety while out on the road.|1|2024-10-06 06:20:32
1032|47|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and while I made the delivery on time, I’ve got to say, the whole experience was a real headache. The Operations department really dropped the ball this time; the load was poorly packed, which made it tough to secure properly, and I had to deal with constant road construction detours that weren’t communicated to me beforehand, adding unnecessary stress to my trip. I clocked in over 17 hours on the road with a stress level that was through the roof—almost a 10 out of 10! It’s frustrating when basic logistics aren't handled efficiently, especially when we're out here working hard to meet deadlines. I hope you can address these issues so it doesn’t happen again.|1|2024-10-07 08:02:48
1033|47|39|1|1|I need to raise a serious issue regarding my recent experience with route 39. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress levels up to a staggering 15.4 out of 10. To make matters worse, the Finance department has been a nightmare to deal with; they’ve messed up my pay for this route and provided zero support when I tried to address these issues. With an overall trouble score of 8.2, it’s clear that something needs to change. We shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stress and lack of support while trying to do our jobs safely and efficiently.|1|2024-10-07 23:51:20
1034|47|20|1|1|I need to voice my frustration regarding the Finance department after my recent trip on route 20, which took me a grueling 18.43 hours to complete, and was unfortunately late. I’ve been driving for a decade now, and I’ve never felt so stressed out—my stress level hit a solid 12.46 out of 10 during this trip. The way the financial side of things has been handled lately is just unacceptable; there are constant discrepancies in pay and reimbursements that leave me scratching my head. I’ve tried to address these issues before, but it feels like I’m just hitting a wall every time. It’s not just about the money; it’s about feeling valued for the hard work we put in out there. I hope this gets sorted out soon, because it’s really affecting morale on the road.|1|2024-10-09 05:56:23
1035|47|33|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding a lack of support during my recent route 33, which took over 26 hours. Despite successfully delivering on time, I encountered numerous issues that made the experience incredibly stressful—my stress level peaked at a 10 out of 10! For example, I had difficulty accessing crucial documents that should have been provided before the trip, and when I reached out to HR for assistance, I was met with unhelpful responses and long wait times. It felt like I was left in the lurch when I needed guidance the most, which isn’t what I expect from a company that prides itself on supporting its drivers. I really think HR needs to step up their game and improve communication and resources for us on the road.|1|2024-10-10 16:28:43
1036|47|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, which took me nearly 19 hours, and I’ve got to say, the Finance department really dropped the ball this time. Not only did my delivery end up late, but I also ran into some serious discrepancies with my pay that didn’t match up with the hours I worked. My stress level was through the roof at about an 8 out of 10, and I felt like I was just chasing my tail trying to get answers. It’s incredibly frustrating to deal with this kind of nonsense after putting in the time and effort on the road. I really need someone to step up and fix these issues because it’s affecting my motivation and trust in the company.|1|2024-10-13 08:40:13
1037|47|4|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns regarding my recent experience on route 4, which took an exhausting 14.34 hours and, to make matters worse, I didn't even make the delivery on time. Not only did I face outrageous levels of stress—scoring an 11 out of 10—but I also encountered an assault that left me shaken and frustrated. This isn't just about my personal safety; it feels like the Human Resources department has dropped the ball on ensuring proper support and protocols for drivers like me who face these kinds of dangers on the road. Overall, my trouble score for this trip was an 8.04 out of 10, and that’s unacceptable. We need better communication and support from HR to prevent these issues from happening again.|1|2024-10-28 09:49:01
1038|47|39|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 39, and I’ve got to say, the Operations department really dropped the ball this time. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress I faced during the trip was through the roof—about a 9.7 out of 10! First off, the route was poorly planned; I hit way too many road closures and detours that weren’t communicated to me beforehand, which added unnecessary hours and frustration. Plus, the load I was given was heavier than what’s typically assigned for that route, making it tough to handle, especially in the tight spots. I’ve been driving for over ten years, and I expect better coordination and support from Ops. We need clearer communication and better planning to help us do our jobs effectively without all this added stress.|1|2024-10-29 17:42:06
1039|47|1|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the reimbursement for my recent trip on route 1, which took me 14.57 hours. While I managed to deliver on time and without any issues on the road, I’ve noticed some discrepancies in my reimbursement breakdown that just don’t add up. I expected to see a proper reflection of my expenses, but instead, it seems like some of my allowances were either underestimated or overlooked completely, which is pretty disappointing given the amount of effort I put into this job. I really hope you can look into this and get it sorted out, as it’s causing unnecessary stress on top of an already demanding job. Thanks for your attention to this matter.|1|2024-11-05 07:43:02
1040|47|33|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I faced on Route 33 that have left me extremely frustrated, particularly with the Finance department's handling of my payments. Not only did my delivery run late, but I also encountered a distressing situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which ramped my stress level to a staggering 11.42 out of 10. To top it off, my overall trouble score for this route was an 8.13, which is unacceptable. The financial compensation I’m receiving doesn’t reflect the chaos and risk I went through, and it seems like there’s a lack of communication and support from the Finance team to rectify these situations. I’m hoping to see some real changes and a proper resolution to this mess because I can’t keep working under these conditions.|1|2024-11-27 09:23:43
1041|47|1|1|1|I just wrapped up route 1, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced with the Operations department. First off, while I did make the delivery on time, the stress level was through the roof—about a 9.3 out of 10, and I can attribute that to the lack of communication and support I received. I encountered multiple delays due to poor route planning, and it felt like I was driving in circles at times. The GPS instructions were outdated, which wasted precious hours and left me frustrated. Plus, there was no backup plan or assistance when I hit those roadblocks. It's about time we get better support and more accurate info to make our jobs easier and safer!|1|2024-11-28 16:27:25
1042|47|42|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 42, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with how things are being handled in the Operations department. Even though I managed to get the delivery done on time, the whole trip took over 11 and a half hours, which is just way too long for this route. The communication from dispatch was spotty at best, leaving me in the dark about a couple of unexpected detours that really messed with my schedule. Plus, there were some serious delays at the drop-off point due to lack of coordination on their end. I’ve been driving for 10 years, and this isn’t the standard I expect. The stress level peaked around a 7.5 during the trip because of all the unnecessary hassles, and I really think we need to address these issues to make it smoother for everyone involved.|1|2024-11-29 07:15:43
1043|47|4|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing Route 4, which took over 15 hours and was anything but smooth. Not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also encountered a serious situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which left me shaken and on edge. With a stress level hitting a 10 out of 10, it’s unacceptable that I had to deal with this on top of the already overwhelming issues we face daily. The overall trouble score for this trip is sitting at an 8, and I can’t help but feel that the lack of support and communication from Operations is a big part of the problem. We need better planning and a safer work environment; this isn’t just about me, it's about all of us out there on the road.|1|2025-01-03 06:06:09
1044|47|33|1|1|I’m writing to raise some serious concerns about my recent experience on route 33, which took me nearly 22 hours to complete—far longer than expected, and definitely not on time. Not only did I face outrageous delays, but I was also assaulted during the trip, which left me feeling unsafe and highly stressed, rating my stress level at around 15 out of 10. The overall trouble I encountered on this route was an 8.8 out of 10, and it’s unacceptable that drivers like me have to deal with such issues without adequate support from the Operations department. I really hope you take this seriously and work on improving the situation for the safety and well-being of all drivers.|1|2025-01-08 09:50:14
1045|47|20|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department following my completion of route 20. While I managed to deliver on time, the experience was far from smooth. The excessive stress level of 12.41 out of 10 was largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my route details and compensation. It’s disheartening to feel like I’m out here driving for hours with no clear answers or assistance when needed. I’ve been driving for 10 years now, and I expected better from a company that values its drivers. We deserve timely updates and proper support to alleviate the pressure on the road, not to mention clear answers about our compensation structure. Please address these issues so we can focus on doing our jobs without the added stress.|1|2025-01-10 10:48:03
1046|47|1|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 1, which took me a grueling 11.2 hours, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress levels during the trip were off the charts, hitting a 9.4 out of 10, and that's unacceptable for a job that should be manageable. There were multiple delays due to poor communication regarding the loading schedule, which left me sitting around longer than necessary and added to my frustration. Plus, the lack of proper route planning meant I hit a few roadblocks that could have easily been avoided. I’ve got a decade of experience under my belt, and this kind of disorganization is just not cutting it. We need to get our act together to make these runs smoother for everyone involved.|1|2025-01-10 22:09:32
1047|47|45|1|1|I’m writing to raise some concerns about the Finance department after completing route 45, which took me a solid 18 hours and change to finish, and I did get the delivery done on time. However, I’ve been having some serious issues with the reimbursement process for my expenses. I submitted my receipts over a week ago, and I’m still waiting for any word or approval, which is really frustrating. It feels like there’s a significant delay in processing, and with my stress level already sitting around 7.8, it’s just adding to my plate. I’ve been driving for 10 years now, and I’ve never had this kind of hassle with getting reimbursed. I’m hoping you can look into this, as it’s becoming a real headache for me.|1|2025-01-13 06:40:14
1048|47|39|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 39, which took me over 8 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with unexpected delays, but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level through the roof—seriously, I felt like I was at an 11 out of 10! To top it all off, the lack of support from HR in addressing these safety concerns is unacceptable. I’ve been driving for 10 years, and I’ve never felt this uneasy on the road. It’s high time that HR step up and ensure that we’re not just numbers on a spreadsheet but valued drivers who deserve a safe working environment.|1|2025-02-04 20:37:50
1049|47|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, which took me a grueling 22 hours, and while I delivered on time, I have to say I'm really fed up with the Finance department's lack of communication and support. I submitted my expense reports weeks ago, and I’ve yet to see a dime, which is incredibly frustrating given how hard I work out there. On top of that, the way they handle reimbursements is all over the place—it's like they’re playing hide and seek with my money! The stress was off the charts, sitting at a solid 10 during the trip, mostly because I was worried about how long it would take to get paid, which just seems unfair after putting in all that time on the road. I really need them to step up their game because this isn't just about the money; it’s about respect for the work we do.|1|2025-02-10 17:37:20
1050|47|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, which took me a solid 13.3 hours, and while I made the delivery on time, I’ve got to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department. When I checked my pay stubs, there were discrepancies that didn’t add up, specifically with the mileage and bonus calculations; it's like they just tossed random numbers together. I’m feeling pretty frustrated here, especially after a long trip with a stress level around 7.8—I'm not asking for much, just a little accuracy and transparency in my pay. It’s hard to stay motivated when I can’t trust what I’m earning for my hard work.|1|2025-02-12 14:56:42
1051|48|23|1|1|I’m really frustrated with the Human Resources department after my recent trip on route 23, which took an exhausting 23.85 hours. Not only was I late with the delivery, but I also had to deal with an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out—my stress level was off the charts at 11.65 out of 10. It feels like no one in HR is taking our safety seriously or providing the support we need when things go south. This whole experience has left me feeling unsupported and frankly, a bit angry about how issues like these are handled. My overall trouble score for this trip was a staggering 8.15 out of 10, and I really think HR needs to step up and address these problems before someone gets seriously hurt.|1|2024-04-12 12:19:14
1052|48|26|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 26, which took me over 13 hours. While I managed to deliver on time and didn't face any serious issues, the lack of support from HR has been overwhelming. I had to deal with some pretty stressful situations on the road, and it felt like there was no one to turn to for help or guidance. It’s like HR is completely out of the loop when it comes to the realities we face as drivers. This lack of communication and support is really taking a toll on us out here, and I think it's time for HR to step up and actually listen to what we need.|1|2024-04-15 19:55:09
1053|48|11|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 11, and I really need to voice some frustrations about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the journey was a real headache, taking just over 17 and a half hours. The route planning was off; I hit unexpected traffic that wasn’t mentioned, which added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level was a solid 7.3 out of 10, and that’s not something I take lightly. Plus, communication could’ve been way better—there were no updates on potential delays or alternate routes. I think the Operations team needs to step it up to make our jobs a little smoother. Thanks for listening!|1|2024-04-17 15:48:14
1054|48|18|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 18, which took an exhausting 15.83 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of the trip—my stress level was through the roof at about 11.5/10—but I also experienced an assault during the delivery, which is completely unacceptable. To top it all off, the lack of support and communication from Finance regarding my expenses and compensation for this trip has made everything worse. With an overall trouble score of 8.08/10, I really think it’s time for some serious changes in how the Finance department handles these situations.|1|2024-05-01 00:57:10

Despite delivering on time, I felt completely unsupported throughout the trip. The lack of communication regarding my schedule changes and the absence of timely updates made the whole experience way more stressful than it needed to be — my stress level hit a 9.18 out of 10! On top of that, I encountered issues with my pay not reflecting the overtime hours I logged, which is really disappointing after putting in all that work. I think it’s high time the HR department stepped up and addressed these ongoing issues because it’s affecting our morale and performance on the road.|1|2024-05-04 19:58:51

While I delivered on time and didn’t face any major issues on the road, I’ve been dealing with inconsistent pay for my last few trips, and it’s really starting to get on my nerves. I’ve noticed discrepancies in my mileage reimbursement and the hours logged, which makes it hard to trust what I’m getting paid for. It’s not just about the money; it’s about feeling valued for the hard work I put in.

It's really stressful, and with my stress level already sitting at a solid 11 out of 10 during the trip, dealing with this financial mess is just piling on.

1059|48|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and honestly, I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department's handling of my pay for this trip. I completed the route in just over 14 hours and delivered everything on time, but when I checked my pay stub, it was way off. I’ve been with the company for 8 years, and I’ve never seen such a mess with my compensation. The stress level during the trip was already high at about 8.5 out of 10, and now this just adds to my frustration. I need to know why my pay doesn’t reflect the hours I worked and the effort I put into making the delivery happen smoothly. It's really disappointing, and I hope to get this sorted out quickly.|1|2024-05-12 20:50:45

Not only did I have to deal with the stress of the delay, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which was completely unacceptable and put my safety at risk. My stress levels were off the charts, hitting an 11 out of 10, and I’d rate my overall trouble with this route at an 8.1. I feel like there was a lack of support and communication from the Operations team, and this incident really highlights some serious issues that need addressing.

1061|48|23|1|1|Hey there, I'm reaching out to vent about some serious issues I've had with the HR department lately. After completing route 23, which took me over 22 hours, I expected a smoother experience regarding my pay and benefits. Instead, I'm still waiting on some reimbursements that were promised weeks ago, and the lack of communication from HR has been incredibly frustrating. I shouldn’t have to chase down answers when I’m out on the road, especially with my stress level already hitting a 9.8 during the trip. Honestly, the overall trouble score for this mess is only a 2.1, but it feels way worse when I’m dealing with HR’s inefficiency. Can we please get this sorted out? Thanks.|1|2024-08-17 13:39:31
1062|48|13|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 13, which took nearly 18 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication and support from Operations was frustrating. There were multiple instances where I was left waiting for crucial instructions, and when I did receive them, they were often unclear or inconsistent. This added unnecessary stress to my trip, pushing my stress level up to over 8 out of 10, which is pretty high considering I’m usually pretty good at handling long hauls. I think we need better coordination and clearer guidelines from Operations to make our jobs a bit easier and less stressful.|1|2024-08-20 23:33:44
1063|48|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess—there were unexpected road closures that weren’t flagged on the GPS, which added unnecessary stress and confusion to my trip. I spent almost 19 hours on the road, and the lack of communication regarding detours was frustrating, to say the least. Also, I noticed that my fuel stop locations were not optimized; I had to search for stations that weren’t even on my route, wasting both time and fuel. This could have been easily avoided with better planning from your end. I hope you can sort this out for future routes because it really took a toll on my overall experience.|1|2024-08-22 09:34:58
1064|48|26|1|1|I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 26, which took me over 11 hours to complete—definitely not on time, and honestly, it was a nightmare. Not only did I have to deal with ridiculous delays and a stress level that felt like a 10.7 out of 10, but I also experienced an assault during the delivery, which is totally unacceptable. To top it all off, the lack of support from the Finance team regarding the reimbursement for the extra time and the stress I've endured is just adding to my overall trouble score of 8.1. It's time for someone to step up and address these issues because this can't keep happening to drivers like me.|1|2024-10-25 17:06:10

My stress level hit around 15.89 out of 10, and overall, I'd rate the trouble I encountered at about 8.81 out of 10. I feel like the lack of support and proper planning from Operations put me in a dangerous situation, and it's unacceptable.

While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication regarding detours and traffic patterns made the trip way more stressful than it needed to be—my stress level hit nearly 13 out of 10! I also found myself dealing with incorrect delivery drop-off details, which cost me valuable time. Even though my overall trouble score was low, these kinds of avoidable issues really pile up and make my job a lot harder.

It seems like they can't get their act together when it comes to processing reimbursements and payments. I submitted my expenses over a week ago, and there's still been no movement. This lack of communication and efficiency is really adding to my stress levels, which were already sky-high during the trip, hitting a 9.8 out of 10. It feels like I’m working twice as hard to get what I’m owed, and honestly, it’s beyond frustrating. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-10-30 05:45:41
1068|48|23|1|1|I just wrapped up route 23, which took me nearly 24 hours, and I have to say, the Operations department really dropped the ball on a few things. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of clear communication about the load’s weight and the poorly planned rest stops made the whole trip way more stressful than it needed to be—my stress level hit an 8.2! Plus, I encountered some seriously confusing directions that added unnecessary time to my journey. I get that every trip has its challenges, but a little more coordination and clarity from Operations would go a long way in making our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-10-31 18:57:40

Not only did I deal with the stress of an extended drive, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 12 out of 10. To top it off, the financial support and communication from the Finance team have been severely lacking, making an already tough situation feel even worse.

I’ve got 8 years of experience under my belt, and it’s disheartening to deal with these avoidable issues that impact my job and well-being.

While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was riddled with unnecessary stress that could’ve been easily avoided. The route was poorly planned, and I encountered unexpected delays due to inadequate communication about road closures and traffic conditions. This pushed my stress level to a 9.2 out of 10, which is ridiculous for a job that should be straightforward. I’ve got 8 years behind the wheel, and I can’t remember a time when I felt this overwhelmed over something that could’ve been handled better.

It’s incredibly frustrating to put in the long hours and then see my paycheck not reflect the hard work I put in. I’ve tried reaching out for clarification, but the response has been slow and unhelpful, which only adds to my stress levels!

I expected a smooth reimbursement given my experience, but instead, I’ve been met with delays and unanswered emails about the mileage rates and fuel reimbursements. It’s incredibly stressful, especially when you factor in my high stress levels during the trip—almost a 10! I’ve been driving for 8 years, and I’ve never seen such inefficiency.

It felt like I was driving in circles just trying to get clarity on where to go.

1102|49|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was a mess thanks to the lack of communication and poor route planning. My stress level was through the roof, sitting at around 8.8 out of 10, mainly because of unnecessary detours and conflicting information about stop locations. It felt like I was driving in circles for hours, and it really affected my overall experience. I expected better coordination, especially after three years on the road; a trouble score of 2.5 just doesn’t cut it!|1|2024-04-27 09:34:57
1103|49|9|1|1|I just wrapped up route 9, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the lack of communication regarding my route details was a real hassle; I ended up spending way too much time trying to figure out the best stops and dealing with unexpected detours that weren’t mentioned beforehand. The stress level hit a 7.6 for me during the trip, which is not what I signed up for. It feels like there’s a disconnect somewhere, and it’s making our jobs harder than they need to be. I really think we need better coordination and clearer info from Ops to avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-04-28 13:07:40
1104|49|36|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious dissatisfaction with the Human Resources department regarding my recent trip on route 36, which took an exhausting 13.64 hours and ended up being late. Not only was the delivery behind schedule, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed to the max, with a stress level peaking at nearly 12 out of 10. To top it off, the overall trouble I encountered was an 8 out of 10, which is unacceptable. I feel let down by the lack of support and communication from HR, especially considering the dangerous situation I was in. I need to know what steps are being taken to address these issues and ensure that drivers like me are better protected and supported in the future.|1|2024-05-06 05:08:21
1105|49|12|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 12, which took a grueling 12.85 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious issues with the Human Resources department that I need to address. First off, their lack of support when I reached out about my mounting stress levels—sitting at a whopping 10.2/10—was just unacceptable. I felt like I was left hanging without any resources or assistance to cope with the pressure of the job. Plus, I've been experiencing some inconsistencies with my pay that no one seems to want to clarify, and that only adds to the overall stress. It's frustrating to feel so unsupported, especially when I’m trying my best out here.|1|2024-05-06 23:22:08
1106|49|20|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 20, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to vent about some serious issues I faced along the way. First off, the communication from the Operations department was completely lacking; I had no updates on the load changes until I was already on the road, which really ramped up my stress level to an 8.7 out of 10. Plus, the route they provided was riddled with construction zones that weren’t marked in the GPS—made my trip stretch to almost 17 hours! It feels like nobody's paying attention to the real-world challenges we face out here. It's frustrating when you’re trying to do a good job and the support just isn’t there.|1|2024-05-08 18:37:46
1107|49|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, which took me a grueling 13.2 hours, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip; it doesn't match what I was quoted before setting out. It’s frustrating to work hard and then find out you’re not getting what you deserve. Plus, I had to jump through hoops just to get someone on the phone to address my concerns about these missing funds. It’s like they don’t care about the drivers who keep this company moving. We deserve better communication and transparency, especially when it comes to our paychecks.|1|2024-05-12 07:20:55
1108|49|45|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 45, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the overall experience was far from smooth. The route was poorly planned, leading to excessive delays at check-in points, which ate away at my time and increased my stress level to a solid 7.6 out of 10. It felt like the team dropped the ball on coordinating with the loading docks, causing me to sit around waiting for hours. On top of that, the communication from Operations was nearly non-existent, leaving me in the dark about changes to the schedule. I’ve only been driving for three years, but this kind of disorganization isn’t something I expected, and it made the whole trip way more stressful than it should have been.|1|2024-05-18 21:34:28
1109|49|44|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent Route 44 trip, which took about 20.7 hours. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole experience was marred by a lack of communication and support from HR. I encountered several issues with my paperwork that weren't resolved before I hit the road, and despite my attempts to reach out for help, I felt completely ignored. This added unnecessary stress to an already long trip—my stress level during the drive was a solid 7.3 out of 10. It’s really disappointing to feel like there’s no one to back you up when you need it. I expect better from HR, especially after three years on the job.|1|2024-05-22 12:42:05
1110|49|9|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing Route 9, which took a grueling 17.8 hours and was far from on time.

To top it off, the overall trouble I encountered was an 8.1 out of 10, which is simply unacceptable. It feels like the Finance team is not adequately addressing the issues drivers face on the road, especially when it comes to ensuring timely payments for our hard work and the dangers we face. I need this addressed ASAP!|1|2024-06-06 09:42:16
1111|49|45|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 45, and I’ve got to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole trip was a nightmare, taking over 20 and a half hours, and my stress level was through the roof at an 11 out of 10—seriously, that’s way too much for one run! The load was poorly documented, which made it a hassle at every stop, and the communication from dispatch was spotty at best. I was left hanging for updates, with no clear directions, and it felt like I was driving blind half the time. The overall trouble score of 3.19 might sound manageable, but the constant confusion and lack of support made it a frustrating experience that really needs to be addressed.|1|2024-06-12 00:36:08
1112|49|12|1|1|I just wrapped up route 12, which took me over 14 hours to complete, and I really need to voice my frustration with the Human Resources department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I faced during the trip was off the charts—seriously, I was at a 9.2 out of 10! I’ve got three years of experience, and I feel like the lack of support and communication from HR is making it harder to do my job effectively. There’s been zero follow-up on the issues I raised previously, and it’s really starting to wear me down. It shouldn’t feel this tough to get basic information or support when I’m out on the road, and the lack of response just adds to the stress. We need better communication and a more supportive environment to keep us drivers feeling valued and focused.|1|2024-06-12 21:52:23
1113|49|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I’ve got to say, the experience was beyond frustrating. First off, I was late on the delivery, which is never ideal, but the real kicker was the lack of support from the Operations department throughout the trip. I spent nearly 28 hours on the road, and the whole time, I felt like I was on my own. The stress level was off the charts—close to a 10! I ran into several unexpected delays that could have been avoided with better planning or communication from Ops. It’s really disappointing because as a driver, I rely on the support team to ensure everything goes smoothly, but this time it felt like I was just left hanging.|1|2024-06-14 06:32:31
1114|49|7|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 7, and while I did manage to deliver on time, I have to say the whole experience was pretty frustrating. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one—there were several instances where I was left waiting for hours to get the necessary paperwork sorted out, which ate into my time on the road and cranked up my stress level to almost an 8. Plus, the lack of clear communication about detours and road conditions made the trip feel way more chaotic than it needed to be. I’ve been driving for three years now, and I expected better coordination and support from the Ops team. It’s tough to stay focused and keep a cool head when these issues keep popping up.|1|2024-06-14 20:04:02
1115|49|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I need to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the experience was far from smooth. The load was improperly secured, which had me worried the whole trip; I can’t even tell you how stressful it is to drive with that on your mind—it was like a constant 8 out of 10 in stress! Plus, I had issues with the routing software they provided; it led me through some really sketchy backroads that added unnecessary time and hassle to my trip, despite the overall trouble score being a measly 2.77/10. I expect more consistency and better support, especially with the kind of stress we face out here on the road.|1|2024-06-15 19:07:10
1116|49|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, which took me a grueling 17.22 hours, and I need to address some serious issues with the Finance department. Despite delivering on time, I’ve been left in the dark about my compensation for this trip—I've yet to see any updates on my pay, and it’s incredibly frustrating. I understand that things can get busy, but my stress levels were already through the roof at an 8.4 out of 10 during the trip, and the last thing I need is to be worrying about my paycheck on top of everything else. The overall trouble score for this trip was relatively low at 2.66, but this ongoing payment problem is really bringing my morale down. Can someone please get back to me with some clarity on my payment status?|1|2024-06-18 20:53:31
1117|49|31|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 31, and while I managed to deliver on time, I've got to bring up some issues I faced that really need addressing. The communication from the Operations department was seriously lacking; I wasn't given clear directions for a couple of the stops, which added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level hit about a 7.25 at one point. Plus, I noticed that the load I was carrying wasn’t properly documented, which made me anxious about potential discrepancies upon delivery. It’s frustrating when the backend support isn’t up to par because it makes my job way harder than it needs to be. I really hope you can take a look at these issues so we can avoid them in the future.|1|2024-06-24 23:37:29

The trip took nearly 17 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, the stress was off the charts—like a solid 10 out of 10. I encountered several issues with the routing instructions that had me driving in circles for way too long, wasting precious time and energy. Plus, I had a frustrating experience at the loading dock where the paperwork was all messed up, causing unnecessary delays. I get that things can be hectic, but this level of disorganization is unacceptable, especially for someone who's been in the game for a few years. I really think we need to improve communication and efficiency, or it’s just going to keep getting worse.|1|2024-07-08 04:26:45

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which left my stress level sky-high at over 11 out of 10.

While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the whole trip took me 13 hours, and I felt like I was running on fumes by the end. The routing from the Operations department was way off; I hit way too much traffic due to poorly planned routes, which cranked my stress levels up to a near 10.

This kind of neglect adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job, and with a stress level of almost 8/10 during the trip, I really expected better from the HR team. It’s disheartening to feel like my concerns aren’t taken seriously, especially after 11 years of dedicated service.|1|2024-02-29 18:06:21
1143|50|4|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I encountered on route 4, which took an exhausting 13.11 hours and ended up being way late for delivery. Not only did I face a ridiculously high stress level of over 10 during the trip, but I also experienced an assault that left me shaken and questioning my safety on the job. The operations department clearly dropped the ball on planning and communication, and it’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such chaos while trying to do my job. My overall trouble score was an 8.05, which is just ridiculous considering I’ve got 11 years of experience and shouldn’t be dealing with this kind of nonsense.

1144|50|13|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced during my recent trip on route 13, which took nearly 19 hours. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress level was through the roof, hitting an 8.8 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one: communication about the route was confusing, and it felt like I was left in the dark about key stops and potential delays. This lack of clarity not only ramped up my stress but also made the whole experience feel unnecessarily chaotic. A little more support and clearer information could have made a world of difference, and I think it’s crucial for the team to address these gaps for the sake of all drivers.|1|2024-03-16 00:15:57

The trip took me a grueling 12 hours and I felt like I was running a marathon the whole time, with a stress level that peaked at nearly 12 out of 10. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of proper routing and communication made it a nightmare.

While I appreciate that the logistics were managed well, I’ve been dealing with ongoing issues regarding my benefits and lack of communication from HR about my recent pay discrepancies. I’ve sent multiple emails and left voicemails, but it feels like I’m just getting ignored, which adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job—my stress level during this trip was around a 7.5 out of 10, and it shouldn’t have to be that way.

While my delivery was on time and the trip itself was relatively smooth, I ran into some major hiccups with the reimbursement for my fuel expenses. I submitted my receipts over a week ago, and I’m still waiting for a response. It’s frustrating because I’ve got bills to pay and I rely on those reimbursements to keep my finances in check.

First off, the communication about the load details was pretty much non-existent; I had to figure out half of it on my own, which ramped my stress level up to an 11.5 out of 10. On top of that, the route they gave me was full of detours due to road work that weren't mentioned beforehand, throwing off my schedule even more.

The routing was all over the place, leading to unnecessary detours that added time and frustration, and the lack of communication regarding rest stops was a huge issue; I felt like I was out there winging it without proper support.

Not only did I face an incredibly stressful trip with a stress level of nearly 11 out of 10, but I also encountered an assault during my delivery—something that no driver should ever have to deal with.

While I did manage to deliver on time, the Operations department really dropped the ball on a few key things. First off, the route info provided was outdated, which forced me to navigate some unexpected detours, eating up valuable time and adding to my stress.

I’ve noticed that my mileage and fuel reimbursements have been either delayed or inaccurately calculated multiple times, and it’s really starting to wear me down.

During this route, I faced an unacceptable level of stress—almost a 13 out of 10—due to a serious assault incident that I believe HR should have addressed more proactively. Not only did this leave me feeling unsafe and unsupported, but it also contributed to an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10 for the trip. I feel like the HR team is dropping the ball when it comes to providing the necessary support and resources for drivers like myself, especially in high-stress situations. It's high time they step up and ensure we have a safe working environment and proper response protocols in place.|1|2024-05-18 18:09:19
1184|52|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and I really need to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was off the charts at about a 10.1 out of 10, and I can't ignore the constant lack of communication and support from the Operations team. There were multiple times when I needed clarification on delivery instructions, and trying to get a hold of someone was like pulling teeth. It felt like I was on my own out there, which is frustrating given my 13 years of experience. I've got a low trouble score overall, but the stress should not be at that level, and I believe better support from Operations could make a world of difference for drivers like me.|1|2024-05-20 21:53:58
1185|52|1|1|1|I just wrapped up route 1, which took me nearly 9 hours, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I’ve got to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the route instructions were vague and had me second-guessing myself a few times, which added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level hit a 7.5 out of 10 at one point! The lack of clear communication on load details and the delivery schedule left me feeling frustrated and anxious. I shouldn't have to deal with this kind of confusion when I’m just trying to do my job right. It’s not just a minor inconvenience; it affects my performance and overall job satisfaction.|1|2024-05-22 02:37:29
1186|52|46|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns about the lack of support from the Human Resources department during my recent route 46, which I just wrapped up after nearly 9.3 hours on the road. Not only was my delivery late, but I also faced a distressing situation where I experienced an assault during the trip, which left my stress level skyrocketing to nearly a 10 out of 10. The overall trouble I encountered was significant, scoring an 8 out of 10, and I felt completely unsupported by HR when I reached out for help.

1187|52|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got to bring up some issues with the Operations department. First off, the delivery info I received was incomplete, which made finding the drop-off location a real hassle and added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level was sitting at about 7.9 out of 10, so you can imagine how frustrating that was. Plus, there were several inconsistencies in the load documentation that I had to sort out on the fly, which is not something I should be dealing with when I’m just trying to do my job. It’s been a rough ride, and I really think the Operations team needs to tighten up their communication and documentation processes to avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-07-07 20:10:04
1188|52|26|1|1|I’m writing to vent about my recent experience with the Finance department after completing route 26, which took me a grueling 9.23 hours and, to top it off, I didn’t even make the delivery on time. The stress was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.57 out of 10, especially after dealing with some serious harassment from a couple of locals during the trip. It was beyond frustrating, and I feel like the Finance team is totally out of touch with the realities we face on the road. Their lack of support and understanding just adds to the overall trouble score of 8.06 I’m dealing with. I really think they need to step up and address these issues because this is not what I signed up for.|1|2024-07-20 07:31:08
1189|52|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I really need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. The planning for this trip was all over the place, leading to a lot of unnecessary stress on my end; I clocked nearly 11.5 hours on the road, and it felt like I was constantly trying to play catch-up instead of cruising smoothly. The load was mismatched with my truck’s capacity, which made handling it a nightmare. Plus, there were some serious communication gaps regarding the pick-up and drop-off schedules that left me feeling like I was in the dark most of the time. I’ve been at this for 13 years, and this kind of disorganization is really not what I expect from our Operations team. Let's get it together, folks!|1|2024-07-22 23:28:02

Not only did I face ridiculous delays that could have been avoided, but I also experienced an assault during the trip that added a massive layer of stress—my stress level was through the roof at about 9.33 out of 10. The whole situation has left me feeling unsafe and undervalued, especially since the overall trouble score of this trip was an alarming 8.12 out of 10. It’s disheartening to see that while I’m out there risking my safety and trying to meet deadlines, the Finance department doesn’t seem to have my back when it matters most.|1|2024-01-04 14:59:45
1195|53|37|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after wrapping up route 37, which took me just over 12.7 hours and was delivered on time, mind you. Despite a decent delivery, I encountered a major headache with the reimbursement process for my fuel expenses; it seems like every time I submit a claim, it gets lost in the shuffle or rejected for vague reasons. This has happened more than once, and it’s really adding unnecessary stress to my job—my stress level was already pretty high at an 8.5 out of 10 during the trip.

1197|53|4|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I encountered with the Finance department after my recent route 4 delivery. First off, the payment for this trip has not been processed yet, and it's been over a week since I submitted all the necessary paperwork. I completed the delivery, which took me 21.14 hours and, to top it off, I was late getting it there. The stress level during the trip was pretty high, around an 8 out of 10, and now dealing with this financial delay is just adding to my frustration. Communication from the Finance team has been lacking, and it feels like I'm just left in the dark about what's going on.

1199|53|43|1|1|I just wrapped up route 43, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say the whole experience was far from smooth. The Operations department really dropped the ball this time—communication was spotty at best, and I had to waste valuable time trying to track down the right paperwork for my load. There were also some discrepancies with the GPS directions they provided, which added unnecessary stress to my drive, pushing my stress level to about an 8 out of 10. With only six years under my belt, I know that things can get hectic, but a little more organization and timely updates would go a long way in making our jobs easier. I hope something changes because this isn't the first time I've run into these issues.|1|2024-03-13 14:54:06

There were deductions made that I don’t understand and they seem way off from what was promised for this route.

We need better communication and support from HR to ensure our safety and well-being out there.|1|2024-03-20 19:54:59
1202|53|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, and I’ve got to say, the experience was far from smooth. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip took nearly 12 hours, and the stress level was through the roof—like an 11.4 out of 10! The Operations department really dropped the ball this time.

We need better planning and communication to avoid this kind of hassle in the future.|1|2024-03-21 08:02:01
1203|53|4|1|1|I just wrapped up route 4, and I’ve got to say, the Operations department really dropped the ball this time.

We need better planning and resources to make our jobs easier, not harder.|1|2024-03-22 12:22:58
1204|53|22|1|1|I just wrapped up route 22, which took me a grueling 25.75 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. First off, my delivery was late, which shouldn't happen after six years of driving; it puts unnecessary stress on me and the whole operation. The stress level during the trip was already high, sitting at around 7.22 out of 10, and having to deal with finance issues on top of that just made it worse. I had expected timely reimbursements and proper communication about my expenses, but instead, it felt like I was left in the dark.

1206|53|5|1|1|I want to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 5 trip, which took an exhausting 15 hours. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the planning and communication leading up to this trip were seriously lacking.

On top of that, I had to deal with poorly maintained equipment that made the journey even more taxing. The overall trouble score for this trip was just under 1.2, so it’s clear there were several avoidable issues that need to be addressed.

1207|53|4|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced during my recent route 4 trip, which took nearly 21 hours.

It feels like every time I submit my expenses, there’s always some sort of delay or missing paperwork that they claim I didn’t fill out right. My stress level was already high at a 7.7 during the trip, and dealing with this on top of everything is just unacceptable. I expected better communication and efficiency, especially since we rely on prompt payments to keep everything running smoothly. This has not only affected my mood but also my confidence in their ability to handle finances correctly.|1|2024-12-11 18:21:19
1224|53|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 38, which took me over 19 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of a tight schedule, but I also experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and feeling unsafe. My stress level was through the roof at about 13.8 out of 10, and I can’t shake the feeling that the Finance team isn’t taking these issues seriously. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and it’s unacceptable that I’m left dealing with these kinds of problems without proper support or communication from your department.|1|2024-12-12 19:14:31
1225|53|18|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 18, and I need to bring some serious issues to your attention. While I did manage to deliver on time, the entire trip was riddled with problems that made my stress level skyrocket to 12 out of 10. First off, the directions provided were confusing and led me through some unnecessary detours that added unplanned hours to my trip, making it stretch to nearly 22 hours! Plus, the communication from the Operations department was practically non-existent when I tried to reach out for clarification, which left me feeling stranded and frustrated. I might have an overall trouble score of 2.38, but I can’t shake off how the lack of support and clarity really took a toll on me this time. Let’s sort this out so future drivers don’t have to deal with the same mess!|1|2024-12-16 03:23:07

I had some questions about my benefits and didn’t receive any answers, which added unnecessary stress to an already challenging trip—my stress level was around an 8.3 out of 10!

While I managed to complete the delivery on time without any major issues, I encountered several problems with the reimbursement process for my expenses. It seems there’s been a mix-up with my mileage claims, and I've been waiting over a week for a response to my inquiries.

I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out, with my stress level hitting a ridiculous 9.9 out of 10.

First off, the route was poorly planned, leading to unnecessary stress and delays at certain points, which bumped my stress level up to nearly an 8 out of 10. I also had a hard time getting accurate updates on the load information, which made it tough to prepare for any potential hurdles.

First off, the delivery was late, which is unacceptable for my schedule and reputation. To make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip that left me rattled and stressed to the max—my stress level was through the roof at 14.08/10! The lack of support and communication from Finance about my pay and compensation for the troubles I faced is just adding to my overall trouble score of 8.17/10.

While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress level throughout the trip was through the roof, sitting at a 9.4. The main issue stems from the fact that my mileage reimbursement and per diem haven’t been processed correctly despite submitting all my paperwork right on schedule. It’s incredibly disheartening to be left hanging like this, especially after such a long haul, and it’s adding unnecessary stress to my already demanding job.

First off, the reimbursement for my fuel expenses was way off; I submitted all the receipts on time, but it seems like they misplaced half of them, and I’m still waiting for an update. To add to that, my last paycheck didn’t include the overtime I worked last month—this is the second time this has happened, and it’s really starting to stress me out.

First off, the GPS directions they provided were off, which made me waste time navigating through some back roads—totally unnecessary. Plus, there were multiple instances where I had to deal with unresponsive dispatchers when I tried to get clarification on the route. It’s frustrating to be driving for almost 9.3 hours, only to feel like I’m on my own out there. The stress level shot up because of it, and honestly, that’s not what I signed up for.

While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication and clarity from HR left me feeling overwhelmed and unsupported, pushing my stress level to an uncomfortable 10 out of 10. I’ve reached out multiple times for assistance, but it seems like my concerns are falling on deaf ears, and it’s just not acceptable for someone who’s dedicated six years to this company.|1|2024-05-04 10:11:15
1265|55|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The trip took an exhausting 19.77 hours, and the lack of communication about road conditions and rest stop availability was frustrating; I felt like I was driving blind half the time. Also, the assigned waiting time at the drop-off location was way longer than it should've been, adding unnecessary stress to an already long haul—my stress level was an 8.8 out of 10! It seems like there’s a disconnect between the Ops team and us drivers when it comes to planning and updates. We need better support out there; it’s not just about getting from point A to B, it’s about managing the journey smoothly too!|1|2024-05-05 12:12:53
1266|55|48|1|1|I just wrapped up route 48, and honestly, I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. First off, this delivery was way late, and I’m not sure if they even bothered to check the paperwork because it felt like a mess from the start. On top of that, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken, and the lack of support from Finance when I tried to report it was infuriating. My stress level was through the roof at 10.5, and overall, I’d give this whole experience an 8 out of 10 in trouble. It feels like nobody’s taking our safety or punctuality seriously, and it's completely unacceptable.|1|2024-06-12 17:36:16
1267|55|6|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the reimbursement for my recent route 6 delivery, which took me just over 19 hours. While I managed to deliver on time and didn’t encounter any major issues on the road, I’m really annoyed that my expense reports are taking forever to process. I’ve submitted all the necessary paperwork, yet I’m still waiting on approvals and payments that should have been handled promptly. This delay is causing me unnecessary stress, especially after a long trip where I already had a high stress level. It feels like I’m doing my part, but the Finance team is dropping the ball, and it’s not cool.|1|2024-06-17 14:46:05
1268|55|38|1|1|I just wrapped up route 38, and I’ve got to say I’m really frustrated with how the Operations department handled things. First off, my delivery was late—22.88 hours on the road and I still didn’t get it there on time, which is unacceptable. To make matters worse, I experienced some serious stress during the trip, hitting a stress level of 10 out of 10, and I even faced an assault situation that made everything worse. Honestly, I felt like my safety was compromised, and it’s really unsettling to be in that position while trying to do my job. With an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10, it’s clear something needs to change in how operations are managed to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-07-16 03:59:03
1269|55|6|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 6, and I need to vent about some issues I encountered that really should be addressed by the Operations department. While I’m glad I made the delivery on time, the stress level throughout the trip was through the roof—around an 8.4 out of 10, thanks to the lack of clear communication about route changes and the inadequate support when I faced unexpected road closures. It felt like I was navigating blindfolded, and that kind of uncertainty is not just frustrating; it can be dangerous. A little more coordination and timely updates could make a huge difference. Overall, I’d rate the trouble I experienced a 1.27 out of 10, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a hassle. We need better planning to avoid these issues in the future!|1|2024-07-16 23:54:56
1270|55|38|1|1|I just wrapped up route 38, and I’ve got to say, I’m really frustrated with the Finance department. Not only did I miss the delivery window, but the stress level throughout the trip was through the roof—like a solid 10 out of 10, which is just unacceptable. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the haul, and it felt like no one was taking my concerns seriously when I reported it. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and I can’t help but feel that if the Finance department had been more communicative and supportive, it might not have gotten to this point. I seriously need some answers and better support moving forward!|1|2024-07-26 03:02:07
1271|55|38|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 38, which took me a grueling 22 hours and change, and I need to vent about the Finance department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I faced during the trip was elevated, hitting around 8.8 out of 10, and a lot of that stress stemmed from the lack of timely communication regarding my expenses and reimbursements. The Finance team seems to be lagging in processing my claims, which leaves me in a tight spot financially after covering all the costs out of my own pocket. It’s frustrating to have to chase down answers and not get the support I need—this has been happening too often, and it’s really starting to affect my morale on the road.|1|2024-07-27 17:13:30
1272|55|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department following my recent trip on route 38, which took an exhausting 17.89 hours—way longer than it should have, and definitely not on time. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which upped my stress level to an unbearable 14.57 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from HR throughout this ordeal has been unacceptable. I feel like my safety and well-being are being overlooked, and the overall trouble I've encountered on this route has reached an 8.15 out of 10. It’s high time HR steps up and addresses these serious issues instead of leaving drivers like me to fend for ourselves.|1|2024-08-01 15:36:57
1273|55|10|1|1|I'm writing to voice my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on Route 10, which took over 11.5 hours to complete. While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress I experienced was through the roof, hitting an 11.37 out of 10. The load was poorly organized, leading to unnecessary delays at multiple stops, and the lack of clear communication about route changes left me feeling lost and overwhelmed. On top of that, the equipment provided was subpar, making the drive even more challenging. It's frustrating to put in so much effort only to be met with inefficiencies that could easily be avoided. I really hope you take this feedback seriously because we can’t keep doing this if we want to maintain a good working environment.|1|2024-08-02 14:51:08
1274|55|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. First off, I didn't make the delivery on time, which is already a huge stressor, but on top of that, I faced an assault during the trip that left me rattled. My stress level hit an insane 16.36 out of 10, and honestly, the whole experience was a nightmare with an overall trouble score of 8.12. I feel like the Operations team isn't taking our safety seriously or considering the real challenges we face on the road. This situation needs immediate attention, as it’s affecting not just my well-being but potentially others as well.|1|2024-08-06 01:33:45
1275|56|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, and I’ve got to say, this trip was a nightmare. First off, I was late on delivery, which is unacceptable for a driver with my experience. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip, which left me feeling unsafe and stressed out of my mind – my stress level was through the roof at a solid 10.4. The overall trouble score for this route was an 8.1, and honestly, it felt like the Operations team dropped the ball on this one. I didn’t sign up for this kind of chaos, and it’s frustrating that I’m out here putting my life on the line while the department seems to be out of touch with the realities we face on the road.|1|2024-02-19 21:42:48
1276|56|38|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 38, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to vent about some serious issues with the HR department. First off, I’ve been trying to get a simple clarification about my benefits for weeks now, and no one seems to respond to my emails or calls. It’s really frustrating when you’re out here on the road for nearly 22 hours, putting in the hard work, and can’t even get basic support from the people who are supposed to help us. On top of that, I feel like there’s a lack of communication about safety protocols and the mental health resources available to us drivers, especially when my stress level was hovering around 8.7 during this trip. It’s high time HR stepped up to support us better instead of leaving us in the dark.|1|2024-02-21 09:51:55
1277|56|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, which took me about 11.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to address some frustrating issues I've been facing with the HR department. First off, my last paycheck was incorrect, and it took way too long to get a response regarding the discrepancy — I felt like I was just getting the runaround. Plus, there have been some inconsistencies with the benefits info that I’ve been trying to clarify for weeks now, and it’s been super stressful trying to get the right answers. I’m putting in the work out here, and it’s disappointing that the support from HR feels so lacking when it comes to resolving these kinds of issues.|1|2024-02-22 05:36:17
1278|56|49|1|1|I need to express my serious concerns regarding the Finance department following my recent route 49, which took an exhausting 20.95 hours and ended up being late for delivery. Not only did I face ridiculous stress levels—around an 11 out of 10—but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which just added to the chaos. On top of that, I’ve been dealing with inconsistent pay and lack of communication from Finance about my reimbursements, making an already tough job feel even worse. The overall trouble score is sitting at an 8, and I can't help but feel that the lack of support from Finance is making my job more dangerous and stressful than it needs to be.|1|2024-03-27 02:54:48
1279|56|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole experience was a real headache. The communication was lacking throughout the trip—there were multiple times I needed to clarify directions and pickup details, but I couldn’t get anyone on the line. The load was also poorly balanced, which made driving a lot more stressful than it should have been, and my stress level hit about 8.88 out of 10 by the end of it. I’ve been doing this for 8 years, and I can tell you that when things like this happen, it not only affects my trip but also my overall morale. A little more attention to detail and better communication from Ops would go a long way.|1|2024-03-28 17:57:35
1280|56|18|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 18, which took a grueling 17.85 hours and ended up being late for delivery. On top of that, I faced an alarming situation with an assault during the drive that left me shaken and added to my already high stress level, which I’d rate at a solid 9.59 out of 10. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.02, and I really feel like the lack of support and communication from Operations contributed heavily to this mess. It’s unacceptable to put drivers in such precarious situations without proper backup or clear guidance, and I hope this gets addressed before it happens again.|1|2024-04-22 00:54:50
1281|56|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The trip took me over 14 hours, and I was late on delivery, which should never be the case. The lack of proper routing and scheduling messed me up big time, leading to a stress level that felt like a solid 9 out of 10. I don't understand how we can keep running into these issues when we’re supposed to be a well-oiled machine. It’s unacceptable, and I really hope you guys can get your act together to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-04-23 03:09:36
1282|56|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, which took me over 12 hours, and I’ve got to say, the Operations department really needs to step it up. While I did manage to get the delivery done on time, the planning was a mess; I dealt with constant route changes that made my stress level shoot up to over an 8 out of 10. It felt like I was just winging it the whole time with no clear direction. Plus, the communication from dispatch was lacking — I had to play catch-up on a couple of unexpected stops that weren't in my original itinerary. It’s frustrating when you’re trying to do your job right and the support just isn’t there. Let’s get some better coordination going, please!|1|2024-04-24 09:00:19
1283|56|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, and I need to express my frustration with the Operations department. First off, the delivery was late, which is unacceptable, especially after the 22+ hours I spent on the road. To top it off, I faced an assault during the trip, which left me feeling unsafe and stressed out of my mind—my stress level was through the roof at a 9.8 out of 10. The overall trouble I encountered was an 8.0 out of 10, which is way too high for what should be a straightforward job. I expected better support and communication from the Ops team, and this experience has seriously shaken my confidence in our processes.|1|2024-10-26 07:38:06
1284|56|40|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 40, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, I faced several frustrating issues that really ramped up my stress level to nearly an 8 out of 10. First off, the loading times were way longer than they should have been, which threw off my schedule and left me feeling rushed. The communication from dispatch was also lacking; there were moments I had no idea what was expected of me next, which is just unacceptable considering we’re supposed to be a team. I’ve been driving for 8 years, and I know things can be hectic, but come on—having to deal with avoidable delays and poor communication is not how we should be operating. It’s time for some changes!|1|2024-10-27 10:06:44
1285|56|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing Route 38, which took an exhausting 20.23 hours. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed to the max, hitting a stress level of 10.57 out of 10. The communication from Operations was abysmal, and it felt like I was driving blind, with no support when I needed it most. This whole experience has left me with a trouble score of 8.13, and it’s unacceptable for a company that claims to prioritize driver safety and efficiency. I seriously hope you take my concerns seriously because this is not how we should be treated on the road.|1|2024-11-21 03:18:18
1286|56|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, and I need to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was off the charts—like a 9.4 out of 10. It felt like I was driving blind at times because I wasn’t given proper updates on traffic conditions or any road closures, which made navigating a nightmare. Plus, the lack of communication regarding my pickup and drop-off times was frustrating; I had to guess if I was going to make it on schedule. Honestly, it’s like they’re not even considering the drivers who are out there busting their butts to keep things running smoothly. I really think we need better coordination and support from Ops to avoid this kind of chaos in the future.|1|2024-11-23 04:33:22
1287|56|38|1|1|I just wrapped up route 38, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. It took me over 21 hours to get the delivery done, and surprise, surprise—I missed the deadline. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which was beyond stressful and left me feeling unsafe and on edge the entire time. My stress level hit a ridiculous 15 out of 10, and I can't believe the Operations department let this happen. Overall, this trip scored an 8.2 on the trouble scale, and I really think the lack of support and planning from Operations needs to be addressed before someone gets seriously hurt or something goes horribly wrong.|1|2024-11-24 13:40:34
1288|56|22|1|1|I just wrapped up route 22, and I have to say the experience was pretty frustrating thanks to the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication about last-minute route changes really threw me off and added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level peaked at over 12 out of 10! Plus, the GPS directions were outdated, leading me through some questionable backroads that were not only time-consuming but potentially unsafe. I feel like with my 8 years of experience, I shouldn’t be dealing with such avoidable issues, and it seriously dampens my confidence in the support we’re getting from Operations. Overall, my trouble score was still decent, but it could have been way better with better planning and communication on their end.|1|2024-11-26 01:57:29
1289|56|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, which took me a grueling 17.37 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursements for the trip were completely messed up; I still haven’t seen any payment for the fuel expenses, and it’s been over a week since I submitted the paperwork. On top of that, there’s been no communication from them about the delays, which adds unnecessary stress when I’m already dealing with a pretty high stress level on the road—like an 8.9 out of 10! It’s frustrating to put in all this hard work and feel like I'm getting slapped in the face by the finance side of things. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-11-27 03:55:18
1290|56|38|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration regarding my recent experience on route 38, which took an exhausting 17.82 hours and ended up being late due to multiple issues that could have been avoided.

The overall trouble score for this route was an 8.04, which is unacceptable. I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball on this one, and something needs to be done to ensure the safety and timeliness of our deliveries.|1|2025-01-03 22:01:09
1291|56|19|1|1|I want to bring up some serious issues I’ve had with the Finance department after completing route 19, which took me almost 14 hours but was delivered on time. Despite my punctual delivery, I've been dealing with consistent delays in the processing of my reimbursements for fuel and tolls. It’s frustrating because I rely on these funds to manage my expenses, and the lack of communication from Finance has only added to my stress, which was already hovering around an uncomfortable 7.9 during the trip. I’d appreciate it if someone could look into this and get back to me, as it feels like I’m being left in the dark without any updates.|1|2025-01-04 13:19:13
1292|56|40|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department after my recent experience on route 40, which took over 6 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I face an unnecessary amount of stress, scoring a solid 12 out of 10, but I also encountered an assault during the trip that left me shaken. This whole situation has been a nightmare, and my overall trouble score is sitting at an alarming 8 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from Finance during this ordeal has made it even worse, and I feel like they need to step up their game to ensure drivers like me aren’t left in the lurch.|1|2025-01-15 02:13:41
1293|56|25|1|1|I just wrapped up route 25, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time—thankfully—I can't ignore the overwhelming stress this trip caused me, sitting at a 9.3 out of 10. The route was riddled with poorly communicated directions and last-minute changes that threw me off my game, not to mention the lack of proper support when I hit a snag with the cargo. I felt like I was navigating a maze without a map, and it really took a toll on my focus and well-being. This kind of disorganization is unacceptable and needs to be addressed so we can do our jobs without the extra headaches.|1|2025-01-15 19:56:39
1294|56|49|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 49, and I seriously need to vent about the Operations department because this trip was a nightmare. First off, I didn’t deliver on time—took me over 23 hours to get it done, and that’s just unacceptable. On top of that, I faced an assault during the journey, which pushed my stress level through the roof at over 12/10; I can't remember feeling this on edge in my eight years of driving. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8/10, and honestly, I shouldn't have to deal with this kind of nonsense. It’s high time the Operations team gets their act together to ensure that we’re set up for success instead of chaos!|1|2025-01-30 19:11:50
1295|56|49|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 49, which took me nearly 35 hours—far longer than expected. Not only was the delivery late, but the lack of communication and support from Operations added to my stress, which was already off the charts. I encountered unexpected detours and unclear instructions that should have been addressed beforehand, leaving me feeling like I was driving blind. With a stress level peaking at almost 11 out of 10, I seriously believe we need better planning and a more responsive support system in place to help us navigate these issues. This isn't just about me; it's affecting our efficiency and overall morale on the road.|1|2025-02-04 07:58:14
1296|56|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department following my recent completion of Route 38, which took an exhausting 21.5 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of clear communication regarding rest stops and fuel locations was maddening. I had to waste precious time searching for a place to refuel, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip—I’d rate my stress level during the drive at about an 8.4 out of 10. It feels like the Operations team could do a much better job of providing drivers with the essential info we need to plan these routes effectively. Overall, my trouble score was low, but the issues I faced could easily be avoided with a little more attention to detail on your end.|1|2025-02-10 13:50:39
1297|56|39|1|1|I just finished Route 39, and while the delivery was on time and I didn't face any serious issues during the trip, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for the mileage and tolls is way off, and I’ve been waiting over a week for a response to my queries. It’s frustrating to spend 12.35 hours on the road, put in the effort, and then have to chase after the money I’m owed. I’m starting to feel like my time and hard work don’t matter, and that’s just not cool. Can someone please look into this and get back to me?|1|2025-02-17 07:00:43
1298|56|22|1|1|I’m writing to express my deep frustration with the Operations department following my recent trip on Route 22, which ended up taking a staggering 17.24 hours instead of the expected time. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an unexpected and alarming situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which left me feeling unsafe and incredibly stressed—my stress level hit 13.56 out of 10! The lack of support from Operations during this entire ordeal was unacceptable, and I’m really concerned about the overall safety and planning of our routes, given that my trouble score for this trip was an 8.15 out of 10. We need better communication and protocols in place to ensure that drivers are not only safe but also able to complete their routes on time.|1|2025-02-22 16:15:57
1299|56|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, which took me 8.52 hours and, while I made the delivery on time, I’ve got to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the communication was a complete mess; I had to play detective to figure out my pickup schedule, and the lack of clarity on load weights had me second-guessing my gear the whole trip. On top of that, the route navigation provided was outdated, which added unnecessary stress and made me feel like I was flying blind. I’m all for keeping the wheels turning, but this kind of disorganization is just unacceptable and really ramped up my stress to an 11.7 out of 10. We need better support out there!|1|2025-02-23 02:30:47
1300|56|38|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent trip on Route 38, which took nearly 18 hours and was far from smooth. Not only was my delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the route that left me feeling unsafe and stressed to the max—my stress level was a solid 16.6 out of 10. To top it off, I felt unsupported by HR when I tried to report this incident; there was a lack of urgency and care that really added to my overall trouble score of over 8.2. It seems like the department isn’t taking driver safety and well-being seriously, and that needs to change.|1|2025-02-27 18:16:14
1301|57|18|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent route 18 delivery, which took an exhausting 20.66 hours and ended up late, despite my best efforts. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed beyond belief, scoring my stress level at a staggering 11 out of 10. I honestly feel like the support from HR is lacking, especially when it comes to addressing serious safety concerns and ensuring drivers like me have the resources we need to handle these situations. My overall trouble score for this trip stands at 8.07, and it’s clear that something needs to change in how HR supports drivers during these challenging and dangerous situations.|1|2024-02-23 19:35:52
1302|57|18|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 18, which took me a grueling 27.14 hours, and I can't help but feel frustrated with the Operations department. First off, my delivery was late, and that just adds unnecessary stress, which was already at a near-breaking point (almost a 10/10). The communication from the Ops team was nearly non-existent when I hit some unexpected roadblocks, leaving me feeling stranded and without guidance. The overall trouble I faced was more than a minor annoyance; it felt like a lack of support from the team made this trip way harder than it had to be. We really need better coordination and timely updates to make these routes smoother, or I’m not sure how much longer I can keep doing this without losing my mind.|1|2024-02-26 07:38:18
1303|57|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, and honestly, I need to vent about the Operations department because this trip was a mess. It took me nearly 16 and a half hours to complete a run that should have been a lot smoother, and to top it off, I arrived late—definitely not what we aim for. The stress level was through the roof at an 8.3 out of 10, mainly due to poor communication about road conditions and incorrect delivery times. It feels like I'm out here juggling too many variables with no support, and that just isn’t how we should be operating. It's frustrating to be on the road for so long and not have the right info or backup to get the job done on time.|1|2024-03-02 01:57:28
1304|57|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and while I managed to make the delivery on time, I’ve got to voice my frustration with the Human Resources department. Over the past few weeks, I’ve repeatedly reached out about some discrepancies in my paycheck and the lack of communication regarding my benefits, but it feels like I’m just getting tossed around with no real answers. My stress level during this trip was already at a 7.1, and the added worry about my pay has only made it worse. It shouldn’t be this difficult to get clear information when I’m out here working hard for the company. I really hope someone can step up and address these issues because it’s affecting my morale and overall experience as a driver.|1|2024-03-05 23:01:12
1305|57|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department following my recent experience on route 38, which took an exhausting 16.6 hours and, quite frankly, was a nightmare. Not only was I late on delivery due to poor routing and lack of proper communication, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me rattled and stressed beyond belief—my stress level was through the roof at almost 12 out of 10! To top it off, the overall trouble score for this route was an 8.1, which is unacceptable. I really feel like the Operations team dropped the ball on this one, and it’s high time we addressed these serious issues for the safety and efficiency of our drivers.|1|2024-03-18 04:42:04
1306|57|18|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department after my recent trip on route 18, which took an exhausting 21.8 hours to complete. First off, my delivery was late, and that’s a huge problem when we’re supposed to be reliable. On top of that, I faced an assault during the trip, which left me shaken and only added to my stress level—honestly, it felt like a solid 16.7 out of 10! To make matters worse, I’ve been dealing with financial issues that I believe stem from miscommunication or negligence on the finance team’s part. My overall trouble score for this trip is an 8.8, and it’s clear that the support I need just isn’t there. I really hope someone takes this seriously because it’s impacting my ability to do my job effectively.|1|2024-03-22 00:35:42
1307|58|1|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns regarding my recent trip on Route 1, which took an exhausting 10.31 hours and ended well past the scheduled delivery time. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an unsettling incident where I was assaulted during my stop, which left me shaken and added to my stress level, hitting a solid 9.4 out of 10. The Operations department needs to be aware of the lack of support and safety measures in place for drivers like myself; the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.03, and it’s unacceptable that we’re out here risking our safety and sanity without proper backup. I really think we need to reevaluate our protocols to ensure that drivers can do their jobs without fear and in a timely manner.|1|2024-01-16 13:52:21
1308|58|29|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 29 in just over 7 hours, which was on time, by the way. While my trip went smoothly with a stress level of about 7.7, I’ve been dealing with some ongoing issues regarding my reimbursements that just don’t seem to get resolved. I've submitted my expenses multiple times, but it feels like they keep getting lost in the shuffle. It's incredibly frustrating to chase down payments when I’m out on the road, and it’s starting to affect my morale. Can we please get some clarity on this?|1|2024-01-21 22:09:56
1309|58|1|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department following my recent route, which took a grueling 9.37 hours and ended up being late despite my best efforts. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that added a tremendous amount of stress, leaving my stress level at a near-breaking point of 9.68 out of 10. On top of that, my overall trouble score for this delivery was 8.04, which is unacceptable. I expected better support and communication from Finance regarding my expenses and potential compensation for the delays and the traumatic experience I endured. It's disheartening to feel like I'm just a number in the system when my safety and well-being should be a priority.|1|2024-03-20 15:40:29
1310|58|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, which took me a grueling 21.65 hours, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my mileage reimbursement was way off; I calculated it based on my logs and it doesn’t match what I was paid. On top of that, my last paycheck was delayed without any heads up, and it really messed with my budget. I’m already stressed out enough with the long hours and tight deadlines (my stress level was an 8.89 on this trip!), so these finance issues just add to the headache. I expect better communication and accuracy when it comes to my earnings—this isn’t the first time I’ve had to chase down missing or incorrect payments. Let’s get this sorted out, please!|1|2024-03-21 20:25:42
1311|58|42|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns regarding the way the Human Resources department has handled my recent experiences, particularly during route 42 that took an exhausting 13.46 hours. Not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also endured a high-stress situation that peaked at a 10.9 on my stress scale, which is unacceptable. To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the trip, and I feel like HR has been completely unresponsive to my calls for help and support. This situation has left me feeling undervalued and unsafe on the job, and the overall trouble I experienced was an 8.01 out of 10. It’s frustrating to think that after nine years on the road, I’m facing this kind of disregard from the company. I really need HR to step up and address these issues, or I’m going to have to reconsider my position here.|1|2024-03-27 20:15:52
1312|58|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and while I delivered on time, I need to bring up some serious concerns with the Finance department. I spent nearly 10.8 hours on the road, and the stress level was through the roof—around a 9.4 out of 10. Yet, when I checked my pay for this trip, it seemed way off compared to what I was expecting. There were discrepancies that I can’t shake off, and it feels like I’m not being compensated fairly for the hard work and long hours I put in. This isn’t the first time I've noticed these issues, and it’s really starting to wear on me. I believe it’s crucial to address this before it becomes a bigger problem.|1|2024-03-29 16:45:28
1313|58|7|1|1|I just wrapped up route 7, which took me about 10.57 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and was on time, I have to voice my frustration with the Finance department. I’ve been battling with them over some discrepancies in my pay for the last few trips, and it feels like I’m getting nowhere. I’ve reached out multiple times for clarification, but the responses have been vague at best, and they seem to be dragging their feet on resolving the issues. It’s really frustrating to put in all this hard work only to have my pay not reflect that effort, especially when I’m already dealing with a stress level of around 7 out of 10 on the road. I just need the Finance team to step up and get this sorted out.|1|2024-03-30 16:27:48

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during this trip, which skyrocketed my stress level to a 9.35/10. I feel like my concerns are falling on deaf ears, and the lack of support from HR has only added to my overall trouble score of 8.02/10. It’s unacceptable that after nine years on the road, I’m dealing with this kind of situation without proper backing or response from the company. I expect better, and I urge HR to step up and address these serious issues.|1|2024-06-07 17:38:08
1315|58|42|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing Route 42, which took me over 12 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the planning and communication leading up to the trip left a lot to be desired. I encountered several issues including a lack of clear instructions regarding the pickup locations, which had me running in circles and added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level was at an 8.3! Additionally, the truck I was assigned had some maintenance issues that were not communicated to me beforehand, causing delays and frustration. Overall, I think the Operations team needs to step up their game to ensure drivers aren’t left in the dark like this.|1|2024-06-08 23:16:31

I really hope you can step up and address these ongoing problems because we deserve better support and safety.|1|2024-08-31 11:11:05
1317|58|1|1|1|I need to bring to your attention the absolutely unacceptable experience I had on my recent route, which took an exhausting 12 hours to complete. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed to the max—my stress level was a staggering 15 out of 10! This kind of situation is not just frustrating; it’s downright unsafe and should never happen to any driver. To top it off, the Operations department failed to provide adequate support or communication throughout the ordeal, which contributed to my overall trouble score of nearly 9 out of 10. We need better protocols in place to ensure our safety and timely deliveries; this is beyond ridiculous.|1|2024-09-04 05:58:02
1318|58|4|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent route. While I managed to complete the delivery on time, the overall experience was far from smooth, with a stress level that hit an 11.7 out of 10. I faced several issues with the scheduling and support during my trip, which left me feeling unsupported and overwhelmed. It seems like there is a lack of communication and organization within HR, and I believe they need to step up their game to ensure drivers like me have the necessary resources and assistance to perform our jobs effectively. This isn't just about getting from point A to B; it's about feeling valued and supported in a demanding role.|1|2024-09-05 05:41:50
1319|58|10|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I encountered with the Finance department after completing route 10, which took me nearly 14 hours and, unfortunately, didn’t go as smoothly as it should have. First off, my payment for this trip was not processed on time, leaving me in a tight spot financially; I rely on these timely payments to manage my expenses. It feels like a lack of communication and organization on their part, and it’s really frustrating when you’re out there on the road, working hard, and then have to chase down your own money. The stress level during this trip was already high at about 8.6 out of 10, and dealing with finance issues just added unnecessary pressure. I really think it’s time for the finance team to step up their game and ensure that drivers like me aren’t left hanging after long hours on the road.|1|2024-09-06 00:40:40
1320|58|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, which took me nearly 18.7 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to voice my frustration with the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit multiple construction zones that weren’t marked in the system, which added unnecessary stress and time to my journey—my stress level was around a 7.4 out of 10! Plus, the load I picked up had a couple of minor issues that I flagged, but no one followed up on them, which could’ve turned into a bigger problem down the road. It’s disappointing because I’ve been driving for almost a decade and expect better communication and support from Operations.|1|2024-09-07 08:39:37
1321|58|10|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I faced with the Finance department after completing route 10, which took me nearly 7.9 hours. First off, my delivery was late, and that’s not just an inconvenience—it’s costing me time and money.

Honestly, my overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and the lack of support or communication from Finance made everything worse. I’m really frustrated and need to know how we can fix these issues moving forward.|1|2024-09-21 15:22:36
1322|58|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, which took me about 8.14 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and I arrived on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel was way off; I submitted my receipts over a week ago and haven’t seen a dime yet. On top of that, my paycheck this week was short due to what I can only assume is a miscalculation on their part. I’ve tried reaching out, but it’s like talking to a brick wall. This kind of hassle adds unnecessary stress to my job, which was already pretty high at a 9.72 during the trip. I expect better communication and prompt resolutions from the Finance team; we work hard out here, and we deserve to be compensated fairly and on time.|1|2024-09-26 00:02:36
1323|58|7|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 7, which took me a grueling 13.44 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to voice my frustration with the Operations department. First off, the directions provided were confusing and led me into a restricted area, wasting valuable time and adding unnecessary stress to an already long trip—my stress level clocked in at a 7.23 out of 10! Additionally, the lack of communication about traffic updates seriously impacted my route planning, and it feels like I'm often left in the dark with no support. I've got nine years on the road, and I can’t remember a time when the operational side of things felt this disorganized. It's getting really frustrating and needs to be addressed.|1|2024-09-27 00:19:28
1324|58|10|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 10, which took me over 8 hours and ended up being late.

It’s unacceptable that after nine years on the road, I’m facing issues like this while trying to do my job. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.04, and I think it’s time for some serious changes in how the Finance department handles these situations.

1325|58|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, even though I made the delivery on time, the stress level throughout the trip was off the charts—close to an 11 out of 10! The lack of clear communication regarding road conditions and unexpected detours left me feeling completely in the dark and made it unnecessarily stressful. I also encountered several issues with the load that weren’t disclosed to me before departure, which could’ve led to major problems on the road. Overall, my trouble score might look okay, but the mental toll this trip took on me was ridiculous, and I think we need to seriously reevaluate how things are being handled on the operational side.|1|2024-09-29 09:55:26

First off, my mileage reimbursement hasn’t been processed correctly; it’s way off from what I expected, and I've been waiting way too long for it to get sorted out. On top of that, I noticed some discrepancies in the toll charges that were deducted from my pay—these numbers just don’t add up! It’s frustrating to have to deal with this kind of hassle when I’m out there working hard on the road. Can we please get this figured out?|1|2024-10-02 19:38:41

Not only was I late on delivery, but I also had to deal with an assault during the trip that left my stress levels skyrocketing—seriously, I was at a 9.8 out of 10 for stress. To add insult to injury, the financial support I expected from the company to handle such unexpected incidents was non-existent, making the whole situation feel even worse. I’ve got a lot of experience under my belt, but this trip was one of the toughest I’ve faced, and I really think the Finance department needs to step up and address these issues to support drivers like me in the field.|1|2025-02-09 11:24:14

Despite being a seasoned driver with 9 years of experience, I found myself not only missing the delivery deadline but also dealing with a level of stress that peaked at an 8 out of 10 during the trip, which lasted over 23 hours. Communication about the route and delivery expectations was unclear, leaving me feeling unsupported and overwhelmed.

The lack of support and communication from Operations during this ordeal was appalling, and it contributed to an overall trouble score of 8.1. I've been driving for 9 years, and this is by far one of the most stressful experiences I've ever had.

1330|58|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and I gotta say, the Operations department seriously dropped the ball this time. The whole trip took me over 11 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, the stress was through the roof—like an 11.5 out of 10 level of stress! There were several points where the directions were unclear, leading to delays and extra stops that should've been avoided. Plus, there was a lack of communication about load weight limits that made handling the trailer a nightmare. I feel like if the Ops team had done their job properly, I wouldn't have been pushed to my limits like that. It's frustrating to deal with these issues when all I'm trying to do is get the job done safely and efficiently.|1|2025-02-12 23:15:13

I can’t believe how disorganized things were; the directions were all jumbled up, and I had to deal with a ton of traffic that could’ve been avoided if the Operations department had done a better job planning the route. My stress level was off the charts at a 9.3 out of 10, and it’s frustrating when the issues could have been prevented with some better communication and foresight. This isn’t the first time I’ve faced these problems, and it’s honestly wearing me down. We need to get our act together over there!|1|2024-03-03 09:26:42

The trip took me a whopping 15.7 hours, which, while I managed to deliver on time, was filled with unnecessary stress due to the lack of clear communication regarding routing and stop times. I felt like I was driving blind at times, and it really impacted my focus, pushing my stress level to a solid 7.4 out of 10. There were also multiple instances where I had to deal with conflicting information from dispatch, which added to my overall trouble score—just under 1 out of 10, but still frustrating.

It feels like I'm constantly battling a lack of communication and clarity around pay issues, and it’s frustrating to deal with after putting in all that effort on the road. This is becoming a recurring issue, and I really need someone to take a look at how things are being managed over there because it's affecting my motivation and trust in the company.|1|2024-03-21 19:40:02
1336|59|1|1|1|I just wrapped up my route and honestly, I have to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I delivered on time, the whole trip was a real headache due to a lack of communication regarding the load details and the last-minute changes to my route that I was only informed of just before hitting the road. It felt like I was flying blind half the time, and it really ramped up my stress levels – I clocked a solid 7.8 out of 10 on that front. Plus, the GPS they provided was outdated, leading me through some sketchy back roads that ate up unnecessary time.

While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was marred by a lack of support and communication from HR regarding my ongoing concerns about working conditions. My stress level during the trip was through the roof at nearly 10/10, and it feels like my previous complaints have fallen on deaf ears. I should not have to grind through such high-pressure situations alone, especially after seven years on the road.

1340|59|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, which took me nearly 20 hours, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip felt unnecessarily stressful due to a lack of clear communication regarding my pickup schedule and an outdated GPS route that led me into some heavy traffic. I had to navigate through unexpected detours that added to my already high stress level of around 7.8 out of 10. It’s like no one in Ops is paying attention to the real-time conditions we face on the road.

Not only did I face extreme stress throughout the journey—scoring a solid 11/10—but I also experienced an unacceptable assault during my route that made the situation even worse.

1346|59|48|1|1|I just wrapped up route 48, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the whole trip was unnecessarily stressful and could have been handled way better. The lack of clear communication about loading times and the confusing route directions really added to my stress level, which hit about an 8.8 out of 10.

It felt like I was driving blind on several occasions, and I couldn’t help but feel that this could have been avoided with better planning and updates from the Ops team. I get that things come up, but when you’ve got a driver on the road for over 13 hours, it’s crucial to keep us in the loop so we can handle these challenges without feeling like we're flying solo.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was off the charts at 13.44/10, and the overall trouble score was 2.45/10, which tells you something's not right. The communication from dispatch was spotty at best; I was left in the dark about some critical detours that popped up last minute, which added unnecessary stress and wasted time. Plus, the load I was given was poorly balanced, making the drive uncomfortable and risky. It's frustrating that after nine years on the road, I still have to deal with these avoidable issues. We need better planning and communication so we can do our jobs without this added chaos.|1|2024-11-05 10:29:58
1427|61|12|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I encountered with the Human Resources department during my recent route 12 trip, which took almost 15 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof, hitting over 10 out of 10, thanks to the lack of support and communication regarding my schedule and breaks. It felt like I was being left in the dark about important details that could have made my job easier. I also had a hard time getting through to HR when I tried to address these concerns before the trip; it was frustrating and made an already long haul feel even longer. I really think HR needs to step up their game to support drivers like me who are out here working hard.|1|2024-11-08 22:12:32
1428|61|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and while the delivery was on time, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The route was over 14.5 hours long, and the lack of proper communication about road conditions and potential delays really added to my stress, which was already sitting around 7.85/10. I encountered unexpected detours that weren’t communicated beforehand, making the trip more tedious than it needed to be. Plus, I noticed that some of the equipment I was provided with was not up to par, which could’ve led to bigger issues on the road. It feels like there’s a disconnect in planning and support, and it’s frustrating when we’re trying to do our jobs efficiently.|1|2024-11-09 15:24:17
1429|61|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and I need to vent about the Operations department because this trip was an absolute nightmare. First off, I was way over the clock at 15.44 hours, and to make matters worse, I didn’t even make the delivery on time, which is unacceptable. On top of that, I actually faced an assault during the trip—seriously, what’s going on with the safety protocols here? My stress level was off the charts at nearly a 10, and I can’t believe this is the kind of support we’re getting from Operations. With an overall trouble score of 8.14, it’s clear something needs to change.|1|2024-12-16 00:45:16
1430|61|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, which took me a grueling 21.67 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the level of stress I dealt with throughout the trip was off the charts—rating it an 8.57 out of 10 is no joke. The communication from Operations was lacking; I had to deal with unexpected route changes and missed fuel stops that made my trip unnecessarily tough. It felt like I was navigating blind at times, and with my experience, I shouldn't have to put up with this kind of chaos. Overall, the trouble score might be low, but that doesn't reflect the high stress and lack of support I encountered, and it really needs to be addressed to improve our working conditions.|1|2024-12-18 00:03:04
1431|62|5|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing route 5, which took me over 15 hours and ended up being late because of a combination of factors that I can’t seem to get any clarity on from HR. Not only did I have to deal with a stressful situation that cranked my stress level up to a solid 11.5, but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which made the whole ordeal even worse. To top it off, I feel like HR has been completely unresponsive to my concerns and hasn’t provided any support or solutions, leaving me with an overall trouble score of 8.2. I really need someone to step up and address these serious issues because it’s affecting my safety and well-being on the job.|1|2024-04-30 02:09:06
1432|62|38|1|1|I just finished route 38, which took me over 20 hours, and I need to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department. Despite delivering on time, I’ve noticed that my compensation for this trip is not reflecting the hours I put in, and it’s pretty frustrating considering the stress I dealt with during the drive—my stress level was through the roof at nearly a 10! It feels like the Finance team isn't properly accounting for the additional hours I’ve worked, and that’s not cool. I’ve been putting in the effort, and it seems like I’m not being rewarded for it. A little transparency and accuracy would go a long way in making sure us drivers feel valued for our hard work.|1|2024-05-01 08:19:06
1433|62|46|1|1|I just wrapped up route 46, which took me a grueling 14.5 hours, and while I delivered everything on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. My pay for this trip was short by a significant amount, and no one seems to have any clear answers when I reach out. I’ve been trying to get this sorted out for days, and it feels like I'm just being tossed around between departments. It’s frustrating because, with a stress level of almost 9/10 during the trip, the last thing I need is to be dealing with payment issues. I really hope someone can step up and fix this mess because it’s starting to feel like I’m not being valued for the hard work I put in.|1|2024-05-02 22:25:54
1434|62|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to bring up some pretty frustrating issues with the Operations department that made the trip unnecessarily stressful. First off, the route provided had some pretty outdated directions, which led me to waste a good chunk of time trying to figure out where I was supposed to turn. Plus, I encountered some major road construction that wasn’t communicated ahead of time, throwing my schedule off a bit, even though I still made it on time. The stress level was higher than it should have been, clocking in around a 7.5 out of 10, and the lack of timely updates and clear directions really added to that. It feels like a little more attention to detail could go a long way in making our jobs easier and less stressful.|1|2024-05-04 01:26:49
1435|62|4|1|1|I just wrapped up route 4, and honestly, I’m fed up with how things are run in the Operations department. First off, I was way late on my delivery—17.47 hours on the road and it felt like I was driving through a nightmare the whole time. To make matters worse, I encountered an assault, and that just pushed my stress levels through the roof—I'm talking an 11 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that we have to deal with such dangers while also trying to meet impossible deadlines. Overall, my trouble score for this trip was an 8.04, which is ridiculous and shows just how poorly this route was planned. It's high time the Operations team gets their act together and prioritizes our safety and well-being.|1|2024-05-31 17:10:32
1436|62|4|1|1|I just wrapped up route 4, and I really need to address some issues I encountered with the Operations department. While I delivered on time and didn’t face any serious problems, the stress level during the trip was through the roof—around 9 out of 10. The route was poorly planned; I hit way too many road closures and detours that weren’t communicated to me in advance, which added unnecessary time and frustration to my already long trip of over 13 hours. I also had trouble with the load assignment; the paperwork was a mess, leading to confusion at the delivery point. This made me feel unsupported, and it’s honestly not what I expect from a team that’s supposed to have my back. We need better communication and planning to avoid this kind of stress in future routes!|1|2024-06-10 18:16:52
1437|62|21|1|1|I just wrapped up route 21, which took me nearly 31 hours, and I gotta say, my experience with the Human Resources department has been pretty frustrating. First off, I’ve been waiting for weeks to get a response about my last pay issue, and no one seems to know who’s handling it, which is unacceptable given the stress of this job. I’ve also noticed a lack of communication about our schedules and routes, making it harder to plan my personal life. With a stress level hitting 9.26 during this trip, I really think HR needs to step up and support us better, rather than leaving us in the dark like this.|1|2024-06-12 03:36:48
1438|62|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to voice some concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was pretty off; I hit some unexpected detours that added unnecessary time and stress to my trip, pushing my total driving hours to nearly 10 and a half. It felt like I was driving in circles at times, and I can’t shake the feeling that better communication could’ve prevented that. Also, I noticed a lack of support when I reached out for clarification on a couple of stops—nobody seemed to have the right info. It’s frustrating because we’re trying to keep things smooth out here, and it just feels like we’re not on the same page.|1|2024-06-17 15:37:59
1439|62|46|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns after completing route 46, which took me over 11 hours and ended up being late for delivery. Not only was the timing an issue, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and my stress levels through the roof at nearly a 10. The lack of support from the Operations department was glaringly obvious; I felt abandoned and unsafe while trying to navigate a challenging situation. With an overall trouble score of over 8, it’s clear that something needs to change in how we handle these routes and ensure our drivers' safety and well-being.

I’ve been dealing with inconsistent responses regarding my benefits and scheduling issues, which escalated my stress level to about a 9 out of 10 during the trip. It feels like I’m just a number to them, and the lack of proper guidance and acknowledgment is really disappointing. Can we please get some clarity and support over here?|1|2024-08-28 22:03:10

First off, my pay for this trip was short—I've been keeping track of my hours, and I’m not seeing the correct compensation for the time and effort I put in. It’s frustrating to deal with this, especially since my stress level during the trip was already sky-high at 9.79 out of 10. I rely on these payments to make ends meet, and it seems like I’m constantly having to chase them down for what I’ve earned. Can we please get this sorted out?

While I managed to make the delivery on time after a grueling 19 hours on the road, the stress level was through the roof—like an 11.99 out of 10! The communication from Ops was practically non-existent, leaving me in the dark about some crucial route changes that popped up unexpectedly; it felt like I was driving blind for part of the trip. Plus, the lack of support when I hit a snag with the loading dock was frustrating—I had to figure things out on my own, which added unnecessary stress to an already long haul. I think it’s time for some improvements in how Operations handles these situations to make our jobs a bit easier.|1|2024-09-30 16:46:03

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress level was through the roof at an 8.99/10, mainly because of the lack of clear communication about the route and the constant changes in pickup times that I wasn't informed about until last minute.

With 6 years of experience, I expect better communication and more attention to detail from Operations to ensure smoother trips in the future.|1|2024-09-21 20:42:43
1467|63|42|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 42, which took an exhausting 9.58 hours and ended up delayed. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the delivery, which cranked my stress level to a staggering 10.5 out of 10. The lack of timely support and communication from Finance only added to my trouble, scoring an 8.04 on my trouble scale. I feel like the department has dropped the ball on ensuring drivers have the necessary backing during such critical and dangerous situations. It's unacceptable that we are left to deal with this alone, and I hope changes can be made to better support drivers in the future.|1|2024-10-10 20:52:32
1468|63|26|1|1|I want to bring to your attention some serious issues I faced during my recent trip on Route 26, which took over 14 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof, scoring an 8.9 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball on communication—there were discrepancies in the delivery instructions that led to confusion at the drop-off point, wasting valuable time and adding unnecessary pressure. On top of that, the lack of support for unexpected detours was frustrating; I had no clear guidance on how to handle the situation. I’ve been driving for six years now, and I expect better from the team behind the scenes. Let's get this sorted out so we can make future trips smoother for everyone involved.|1|2024-10-12 01:13:48
1469|63|26|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 26, which took me nearly 13 hours, and I really need to voice my frustrations with the Human Resources department. While the delivery was on time and I didn’t encounter any serious issues on the road, I’ve been feeling increasingly stressed—my stress level hit a solid 7 out of 10 during this trip. It seems like HR is totally out of touch with what we drivers actually need; the communication is lacking, and the support for our well-being just isn’t there. We need more transparency about our schedules and better resources to manage our time on and off the road. It’s really disheartening to feel like our concerns aren’t being heard, especially when we’re out here doing our best to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-10-12 18:26:49
1470|63|36|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 36, which took me over 11 hours and, shockingly, wasn’t delivered on time. The stress level on this trip was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.45 out of 10, mostly because I faced an assault during my drive, which is completely unacceptable. I can’t believe the lack of support and communication from the Operations team during this ordeal. It feels like they don’t care about the safety and wellbeing of their drivers, and it’s really taking a toll on my mental health. My overall trouble score for this trip would easily rank at an 8.08 out of 10, and I’m fed up with the way things are being handled around here.|1|2024-11-29 00:35:44
1471|63|30|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 30 trip, which took over 12 hours and left me feeling pretty stressed out—about an 8.8 on the stress scale. While I managed to make the delivery on time, I encountered significant issues with the route planning and communication. The GPS provided was outdated, leading me to take longer detours that could have easily been avoided, and I didn't receive timely updates on traffic conditions, which would have made the trip smoother. This kind of oversight makes the job much harder than it needs to be, and it’s disappointing that after six years on the road, I’m still dealing with these avoidable problems.|1|2024-12-01 03:06:48
1472|63|46|1|1|I just wrapped up route 46, and honestly, I’m fed up with the Finance department’s incompetence. First off, my delivery was late, which I think could have been avoided if there were better communication and support from your end. On top of that, I faced some serious harassment during the trip that added to my stress level, which was already through the roof at an 11 out of 10. I can’t believe I had to deal with that on top of late paperwork and confusing pay schedules that are still a mess. Overall, I’m giving this whole experience an 8 out of 10 for trouble, and it’s high time the Finance department gets its act together to prevent these issues from happening again.|1|2024-12-15 14:35:48
1473|63|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and I need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip was riddled with issues that seriously ramped up my stress level to nearly a 10. First off, the load was way heavier than what was initially specified, which made handling it a nightmare, especially when navigating tight spots. Plus, there were a couple of unexpected detours that weren’t communicated beforehand, leaving me scrambling and burning extra fuel. I don’t think it’s too much to ask for better planning and communication to help us drivers out, especially when we’re already under pressure. Overall, the trouble score was only a 2, but that’s only because I’ve been at this for six years and know how to manage chaos; newer drivers could really get overwhelmed. Let’s get it together, folks!|1|2024-12-16 19:55:29
1474|63|45|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 45, which took me a grueling 19.5 hours to complete. While the delivery went off without a hitch and I managed to stay on schedule, the financial side of things has been a nightmare. I’ve noticed discrepancies in my pay that don’t reflect the hours and effort I put in, and it’s causing me a lot of unnecessary stress—my stress level was an 8.9 during the trip. I’ve tried reaching out for clarification, but I’ve been met with delays and no clear answers. This lack of communication and support is really weighing on me, and I just want to get this sorted out so I can focus on driving without this hanging over my head.|1|2024-12-20 05:23:37
1475|63|30|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I've encountered with the Human Resources department lately. During my recent route 30, which took over 15 hours, I felt like I was left hanging with no support when I had questions about my benefits and pay. The lack of communication from HR has been frustrating, and it seems like they’re just not prioritizing the needs of the drivers. My stress level hit a 7 during the trip mainly because I couldn't get the answers I needed, and it just added unnecessary pressure on top of my job. I really think HR needs to step up their game and be more responsive to us out here on the road.|1|2024-12-21 00:07:25
1476|63|46|1|1|I just wrapped up route 46, and I’ve got to say, I’m seriously frustrated with how things went down. First off, the delivery was late, which is already adding stress to my job, but what really took the cake was the assault I faced on the road. I was minding my own business when some aggressive driver decided to take things too far, which left me shaken and my stress level through the roof at an 11.37 out of 10. Honestly, with everything that happened, I’d rate my overall trouble score at a solid 8.02. The Operations department really needs to step up and address these issues because this is not how we should be treated out there.|1|2025-01-07 23:17:02
1477|63|36|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 36, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I have to say the experience was far from pleasant thanks to the Operations department. The route was poorly planned, leading to excessive detours that added unnecessary stress and nearly pushed my driving hours to the limit; I clocked over 10.6 hours on the road! It felt like there was a lack of communication about road conditions and delivery schedules, which only cranked my stress level up to a 9 out of 10. I’m not one to complain lightly, but with my experience, I expect better coordination from Ops to make our jobs smoother and safer.|1|2025-01-10 08:11:20
1478|63|45|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 45, which took me over 23 hours to finish, and unfortunately, I didn’t make the delivery on time. The stress level during this trip was pretty high, around 8.6 out of 10, mainly because of the issues with getting the paperwork sorted out beforehand—it felt like I was chasing my tail trying to get everything approved. The overall trouble score was a manageable 2.3, but the lack of support from Finance really added to my stress and made the whole experience much worse than it needed to be. It’s crucial that this gets addressed so future trips can go smoother.|1|2025-01-13 18:02:15
1479|64|30|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 30, which took an exhausting 11.75 hours and ended up being late.

1480|64|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and honestly, I need to voice some frustrations with the Operations department. While I did manage to get the delivery done on time, the entire trip was a real headache. I spent over 15 hours on the road, and the stress level was through the roof—around an 8.7 out of 10, which is no joke. The route directions were vague, leading me to take unnecessary detours that wasted time and fuel, plus there was a serious lack of communication about road closures that really threw me off. I get that things can get hectic, but these kinds of issues should be addressed to make our jobs easier. It’s tough to stay motivated when these avoidable problems keep popping up.|1|2024-03-21 16:28:35
1481|64|13|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 13, and I have to say, this trip was a complete nightmare. It took me over 15 hours, and not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which left me shaken and stressed out of my mind—my stress level was off the charts at nearly 11! To make matters worse, the lack of support from the Operations department when I reached out for help was frustrating. I’m seriously questioning the safety protocols in place because I shouldn’t have had to deal with that alone. Overall, the entire experience left me feeling utterly unsupported and on edge, and I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to ensure our safety and timely deliveries.|1|2024-04-03 06:05:04
1482|64|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and I need to vent about some serious issues I encountered with the Operations department. While I delivered on time, which is great, the stress I dealt with during the trip was off the charts—seriously, a 9.35 out of 10! The routing was a nightmare; I got sent through a construction zone that wasn’t even on my GPS, delaying me further and making me feel like I was driving in circles. Plus, the communication was terrible; I tried to reach out for help, but it took ages to get a response, and by then, I was already stressed to the max. We need to get our act together because this kind of mismanagement is just unacceptable for drivers trying to do their jobs right.|1|2024-04-04 22:40:32
1483|64|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say I'm pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. For starters, there’s been a lack of communication regarding my benefits and compensation, which has been really confusing and stressful—my stress level during the trip hit a 7.8 out of 10. I also feel like my concerns about safety protocols and work schedules have been ignored, leaving me feeling undervalued after eight years on the road. Honestly, this whole situation is draining, and I just think HR needs to step up their game to support drivers like me better.|1|2024-04-09 10:50:28
1484|64|20|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 20, which took an exhausting 16.81 hours and was far from smooth.

My stress level was through the roof at a 10.14 out of 10, and the overall trouble I encountered scored an 8.08, which is unacceptable.

The reimbursement for my fuel expenses has been a mess; it’s been over a week since I submitted the receipts, and I’m still waiting on my payment. On top of that, the per diem calculations seem way off—I’m pretty sure I’m not getting what I’m owed for my meals.

I’ve reached out multiple times about my pay discrepancies and haven’t received any helpful responses, which only adds to the stress of long hauls like this one. It feels like I'm hitting a wall trying to get answers, and it's really disappointing considering how hard we work out here.

To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which left me feeling completely unsafe and unprotected. With an overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10, it’s clear that something needs to change.

First off, I was supposed to deliver on time, but that clearly didn’t happen, which is frustrating enough. To top it off, I encountered a really scary situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which left me shaken and on edge the entire time—I’d rate my stress level a solid 10.3 out of 10. With all the issues I faced, my overall trouble score hit 8.1, and I can’t help but feel like Operations dropped the ball on this one. It’s unacceptable and needs to be addressed, as no driver should have to deal with this kind of chaos while trying to do their job.|1|2024-07-24 02:03:12

The communication throughout this trip was absolutely lacking; I had to deal with last-minute changes that weren’t relayed to me until I was already on the road, which ramped my stress level up to a solid 9.7 out of 10. On top of that, the load I was given was not properly documented, leaving me to figure out half of the required stops myself.

This kind of situation is unacceptable and makes me question the support we receive from HR.

Everything went smoothly on the road, I delivered on time and didn’t have any problems with safety, but it’s the paperwork and payment issues that are driving me up the wall. I was promised prompt payment for my mileage, but I've been waiting longer than expected, and it’s messing with my budget. On top of that, I noticed discrepancies in my pay stub that I can’t make sense of, which is only adding to my stress. It’s hard to stay focused on the road when I’m constantly worrying about whether I’m getting what I earned.

While I didn't experience any serious issues during the trip, the stress level was a solid 8.5, largely due to the lack of support from HR regarding my recent requests for time off and clarification on benefits. I've been trying to get a response for weeks, and it's incredibly disheartening to feel ignored when I'm just trying to make sure I'm taking care of myself and my family.

Not only did I face significant delays that should have been communicated beforehand, but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which made the whole situation even more stressful—my stress level was off the charts at 12.9/10. To top it off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.05/10, and I feel like the lack of support and communication from Operations has made driving feel more dangerous than it should be. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, and something needs to change.|1|2024-03-09 21:44:48
1508|65|22|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 22, which took me nearly 20 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say I'm really frustrated with the Finance department. There were discrepancies in my pay for this trip that I can’t shake off. I expected my compensation to reflect the hours I put in, especially considering the stress I dealt with on the road, which was off the charts at over 10 out of 10. I’ve reached out to the Finance team for clarification, but it feels like I’m getting the runaround. It’s disheartening to work hard and not see that reflected where it counts. I really need this sorted out ASAP because it’s affecting my morale out here.|1|2024-03-11 20:47:48
1509|65|22|1|1|I just wrapped up route 22, which took me a grueling 19.3 hours, and I've got to say, the Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof—about an 8.2 out of 10—and it felt like I was constantly fighting against the clock because of the lack of proper communication and support. There were multiple times when I was left in the dark about route changes and delays at the drop-off point, which made the whole experience unnecessarily chaotic. I’ve been driving for nine years now, and I’ve never had a trip that felt this poorly managed. We need better coordination and clearer updates to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-03-14 10:09:14
1510|65|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a nightmare; I hit a major traffic jam that wasn’t communicated to me, adding unnecessary stress to an already long trip that clocked in at over 21 hours. I also found that my assigned rest stops were either overcrowded or closed, which made it tough to take breaks and keep my stress levels in check (I rated it a 7.2 out of 10). Additionally, the lack of timely updates from Dispatch during the trip was frustrating and made me feel pretty unsupported out there. I really think we need better communication and planning to avoid these kinds of issues in the future.|1|2024-03-17 19:49:31
1511|65|38|1|1|I just wrapped up route 38, and I’ve got to say, this trip was an absolute nightmare. First off, I missed my delivery time, which is just unacceptable when we’re supposed to be on top of our schedules. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which really ramped up my stress levels to a solid 10. I felt completely unsafe, and it’s infuriating that I had to deal with that while trying to do my job. Overall, my trouble score for this trip was through the roof at over 8, and honestly, I don’t think the Operations department is doing enough to support drivers like me out on the road. We need better protocols in place to handle these situations and ensure our safety.|1|2024-03-27 06:44:45
1512|65|16|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 16, which took me about 17.58 hours, and while the delivery was on time and I didn't face any major issues, I need to raise a serious concern about the Finance department. It seems like there’s been a mix-up with my pay for this trip; I’ve noticed discrepancies between what I was promised and what I actually received. It’s frustrating, especially after putting in such long hours and dealing with a stress level around 9.3 out of 10 during the drive. I’m hoping someone can look into this ASAP because it’s really affecting my motivation out there. It shouldn't be this hard to get paid what I’ve earned!|1|2024-03-28 10:01:13
1513|65|22|1|1|I just wrapped up route 22, which took me over 17 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the HR department. First off, the lack of communication regarding schedules has been a consistent headache; I felt completely in the dark about my next assignments and it adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job—my stress level for this trip was a solid 7.4 out of 10. On top of that, I’ve repeatedly brought up concerns about the outdated equipment we’re using, which puts extra pressure on us drivers to complete our routes without proper support. It’s like HR doesn’t care about our well-being or the challenges we face on the road, and it’s getting really old.|1|2024-03-29 09:12:09
1514|65|23|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns about the lack of support from the Human Resources department during my recent trip on route 23, which took an exhausting 24.18 hours—far longer than expected due to multiple delays that could have been avoided with better planning. Not only was my delivery late, but I also faced an unacceptable level of stress, hitting a 12.29 out of 10, after experiencing an assault from an aggressive driver on the road. The lack of immediate HR support in resolving this incident and addressing my overall wellbeing has left me feeling neglected and frustrated, contributing to a troubling score of 8.03 out of 10 for my overall experience. It’s high time that HR steps up to protect our drivers and ensure we have the resources we need to handle emergencies and stressful situations while on the road.|1|2024-04-04 11:33:05
1515|65|16|1|1|I want to raise some serious concerns about the HR department after my recent trip on route 16, which took me nearly 19 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level I experienced throughout the trip was off the charts, sitting at a staggering 10.8 out of 10. It feels like the HR team is completely out of touch with the realities we face on the road. There’s a lack of support for drivers when it comes to managing workloads and addressing our concerns; I often feel like my voice doesn't matter. It’s frustrating to see that despite my nine years of experience, the issues we face aren’t being acknowledged or addressed. We need better communication and resources to make our jobs less stressful and more manageable.|1|2024-04-07 14:06:38
1516|65|2|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 2, which took an exhausting 7.42 hours and was not delivered on time. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left my stress level at a staggering 15.97 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from Finance has been appalling, especially when I needed assistance the most. With an overall trouble score of 8.22 out of 10, I feel completely let down. It's unacceptable that I'm dealing with this kind of stress without proper backing from the company.|1|2024-04-11 07:12:43
1517|65|23|1|1|I just wrapped up route 23, and honestly, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the sheer stress I experienced during the trip was off the charts—like a 13.16 out of 10! The communication from dispatch was practically non-existent, leaving me in the dark about crucial route updates and delays that could have been avoided. Plus, the load was poorly balanced, making the drive way more nerve-wracking than it needed to be. It’s frustrating because I’ve got nine years under my belt, and this level of disorganization is unacceptable. We need better support and clearer communication to make these trips smoother for everyone involved.|1|2024-04-14 22:21:31
1518|65|29|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 29, which took me 8.42 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the experience was far from smooth. I encountered multiple issues, including inconsistent communication regarding load details and a lack of support when I faced unexpected road closures. My stress level was through the roof, hitting a 9.76 out of 10, mainly because I felt like I was navigating this alone without any guidance or backup from your team. It's disheartening to deal with these kinds of hiccups when I’m trying to do my job right, and I think it’s crucial for the Operations department to step up and improve their coordination and support for drivers like me.|1|2024-04-15 15:03:08
1519|65|2|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding the lack of support and communication I’ve been experiencing lately. While I managed to complete route 2 on time in just over 8 hours, the stress I faced during the trip was amplified by HR's failure to address my previous concerns about scheduling issues and inadequate rest break policies. Despite my years of experience, I feel like my input has been ignored, and it’s getting harder to stay motivated when I’m not being heard. The overall trouble score may seem low, but it doesn’t reflect the ongoing issues that need to be sorted out. I believe HR needs to step up their game to support drivers like me who are trying to do our jobs efficiently.|1|2024-04-19 01:03:15
1520|65|22|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 22, which took an exhausting 17.95 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of the long drive, which was at a solid 9.4 out of 10, but I also faced an assault during the trip that made everything even worse. To top it all off, the lack of proper support and communication from Finance about the delays and the situation left me feeling completely abandoned. This whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I really think the department needs to step up its game to support drivers like me who are out there putting in the hard work.|1|2024-07-19 22:10:57
1521|65|23|1|1|I just wrapped up route 23, and while I delivered on time, I have to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. The communication was a mess; I was left in the dark about a couple of unexpected detours that added a good chunk of time to my trip, making that 19.6 hours feel even longer than it needed to be. On top of that, the trailer I was given had a few maintenance issues that weren't addressed before I hit the road, which really cranked up my stress level to nearly a 9 out of 10 during the trip. I know we work in a tough industry, but better planning and communication could really help ease the load on drivers like me.|1|2024-07-22 04:28:24
1522|65|44|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 44, which took an exhausting 15.46 hours and ended up being late for delivery. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a solid 10.5 out of 10. The communication from Operations was lacking, leaving me feeling unsupported and unsafe on the road. Overall, this experience left me with a trouble score of 8.12, and I honestly can't believe that after 9 years of driving, I had to go through something like this. We need to do better for drivers out here; this isn’t just about schedules, it’s about safety and well-being.|1|2024-08-03 19:05:50
1523|65|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 38 delivery, which took an exhausting 26.8 hours—way longer than expected. Not only was the delivery delayed, but I also faced a lack of clear communication about a last-minute route change that led to unnecessary stress during the trip, which I rated an 8.9 out of 10 on the stress scale. I thought things would improve with my nine years of experience, but this kind of mismanagement makes it tough to stay motivated. I really hope you can address these issues to prevent future headaches for drivers like me.|1|2024-08-06 13:24:55
1524|65|44|1|1|I’m writing to formally complain about my recent experience on route 44, which took an exhausting 17.75 hours and was anything but smooth. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress levels to a staggering 14.6 out of 10. With an overall trouble score of 8.15, I can’t help but feel that the Operations department dropped the ball on this one. There was a lack of support and communication throughout the trip, making an already tough job even harder, and it’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a dangerous situation without proper backup. I really hope this gets addressed so that no one else has to go through what I did.|1|2024-08-07 17:35:50
1525|65|22|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 22, which took a grueling 18.6 hours to finish, even though I delivered on time. While I usually have a decent experience, the stress level during this trip was off the charts at about 11.7 out of 10, primarily due to the constant confusion over my pay and reimbursements. I've been chasing down payment discrepancies for weeks now, and it’s just exhausting to deal with such disorganization. I can’t keep doing my job effectively if I’m constantly worrying about getting paid correctly; it’s impacting my overall morale and ability to focus on the road. This needs to be sorted out, or else it’s going to become a serious issue for everyone involved.|1|2024-08-08 22:10:01
1526|65|23|1|1|I just wrapped up route 23, and while the delivery went smoothly and I made it on time, I’ve gotta address some serious issues with the Finance department that have been bugging me. After my trip, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this route—was expecting a little more based on the hours I clocked (22.67 hours, to be exact), but it doesn’t add up. I’ve reached out multiple times but keep getting the runaround with no clear answers. It’s super frustrating, especially after a long trip where my stress level was already sky-high at a 9.5 out of 10. Can we please get this sorted out? It’s not cool to leave us hanging like this, especially when we’re out here busting our backs on the road.|1|2024-08-16 02:12:56
1527|65|29|1|1|I wanted to take a moment to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent trip on route 29, which took just over 7 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time and there were no major issues during the drive, I was really let down by the lack of communication regarding my scheduled breaks and the overall support from HR. I reached out several times for clarification on my hours and was met with vague responses that made planning my shifts incredibly stressful—my stress level during the trip was a solid 7 out of 10. With 9 years of experience under my belt, I expect better coordination and support, especially when it comes to something as crucial as managing our schedules. It feels like we’re left in the dark too often, and it’s impacting our workflow and morale.|1|2024-08-20 01:01:54
1528|65|44|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration after completing route 44, which turned into a nightmare. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level to a staggering 10.8 out of 10. The lack of support from the Operations department was evident, and it felt like I was left to fend for myself during an incredibly dangerous situation. To top it all off, my overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.0, which is unacceptable. I’ve been in this job long enough to know that we need better communication and support from the Operations team to ensure the safety and efficiency of our routes.|1|2024-10-07 12:43:16
1529|65|35|1|1|I just wrapped up route 35, and I’ve got to say, I’m really frustrated with the way things went down this time. First off, I didn’t deliver on time, which is becoming a regular issue thanks to the lack of proper communication from the Operations department. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level through the roof—I'm talking a solid 16 out of 10! It’s unacceptable that we’re not getting the support we need to keep us safe and on schedule. Overall, I’m giving this trip an 8.8 out of 10 for trouble, and it’s clear that the ops team needs to step it up to prevent these kinds of issues from happening again.|1|2024-10-11 12:56:37
1530|66|12|1|1|I just wrapped up route 12, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department. First off, I didn’t get my delivery on time, which really messed up my schedule. To make matters worse, I had a serious encounter with some aggressive drivers that left me feeling assaulted on the road, cranking my stress level up to an 8.4 out of 10. Overall, this trip was a nightmare with an 8 out of 10 on the trouble scale, and honestly, I think a lot of this could have been avoided if the Finance department had communicated better about the route and any potential hazards. I need to know that my safety and timely deliveries are a priority, but right now, it feels like they’re just dropping the ball.|1|2024-01-01 19:29:39
1531|66|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say that the experience was far from smooth. The Operations department needs to seriously reevaluate their planning because the route provided was poorly mapped out, leading to unnecessary detours that added a couple of hours to my drive. The stress level was higher than it should have been, sitting at around 7.3 out of 10, mostly due to constant navigation issues and unclear instructions. It's frustrating to put in all this effort and time—over 12 and a half hours on the road—only to feel like I was set up for a rough trip. I really think we need better communication and more reliable routing to avoid these hassles in the future.|1|2024-01-03 08:41:35
1532|66|24|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about my recent experience on route 24. First off, the delivery was late, and I was left scrambling to figure out what went wrong with the scheduling—this shouldn't be happening after nine years on the road! To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the trip, which sent my stress levels through the roof—seriously, I was at a 13.5 out of 10! The whole situation was just chaotic, and I can’t shake my overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10; it’s unacceptable. I really think the Operations department needs to step up because this kind of nonsense is not something any driver should have to deal with.|1|2024-01-04 01:37:19
1533|66|30|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I encountered with the Finance department after completing route 30, which took a grueling 15.4 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level throughout the trip was off the charts, hitting a 10.77 for me, largely due to constant concerns about how my expenses were being handled. It feels like every time I submit my receipts, there’s a delay or a mix-up that makes it hard to get reimbursed on time. I can’t keep stressing over whether I’ll get paid for my expenses, especially when I’m on the road for so long. It’s becoming a real headache, and I think it needs to be addressed ASAP to keep us drivers focused on the road rather than worrying about our finances.|1|2024-01-05 08:49:57
1534|66|22|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I encountered during my recent route 22 delivery. First off, I didn't make it on time, which is frustrating considering I put in over 25 hours on the road. The Finance department really dropped the ball on this one—my reimbursement for fuel and expenses hasn’t been processed correctly, and it’s really adding to my stress, which was already sitting at an 8.5 out of 10 during the trip. I’ve reached out multiple times but haven't gotten any clear answers, and it feels like I'm just going in circles. This lack of communication and support is making my job even harder than it needs to be, and I hope you can look into this ASAP.|1|2024-01-06 11:53:19
1535|66|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and I have to say, it was a nightmare. Not only did I miss the delivery deadline, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which has left me feeling incredibly stressed—my stress level was off the charts at a 10.1 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one; I had issues with the load not being secured properly, which led to delays and increased my trouble score to over 8.0. I’ve been driving for 9 years now, and I've never encountered such a dangerous situation while on the road. This is unacceptable, and something needs to be done to improve the safety and efficiency of our operations.|1|2024-03-05 02:20:30
1536|66|12|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 12, which took me about 17.73 hours, and while I’m glad the delivery was on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. It seems like there’s been a mix-up with my mileage reimbursement; I submitted my logs, but it feels like they’re dragging their feet on processing it. I’ve reached out multiple times, and the lack of communication is really frustrating. With a stress level of about 8.4 during the trip, the last thing I need is to be worrying about getting paid properly. I just want to know when I can expect to see my reimbursement, because this is starting to feel like a real hassle.|1|2024-03-06 01:09:21
1537|66|31|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 31, which took an exhausting 15.74 hours and ended with a delivery that was late. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to a staggering 12.98 out of 10. I can't help but feel that the lack of support and proper compensation for the extra challenges I faced reflects poorly on how the Finance team handles these situations. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.06 out of 10, and I really think the Finance department needs to step up and address these issues, as it’s unacceptable for drivers like me to endure such stress without proper acknowledgment or support.|1|2024-03-07 22:32:03
1538|66|12|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing Route 12, which took me just over 16 hours. While the delivery went off without a hitch—arriving on time, thankfully—I encountered serious issues with the reimbursement process for my expenses. Despite submitting my receipts almost a week ago, I still haven’t seen any updates or payments, leaving me in a tight spot financially. This lack of communication and delay is incredibly stressful, especially when I’ve put in the time and effort to ensure everything else went smoothly on my end. It feels like I'm being left in the dark, and it's really affecting my peace of mind out here on the road.|1|2024-03-09 18:00:15
1539|66|24|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 24, which took me a grueling 10.47 hours, and while I managed to hit the delivery window, I’ve got some serious beef with the Operations department. Throughout the trip, I encountered multiple issues that made my job way more stressful than it needed to be—like the lack of accurate route info and delays in getting my load details, which forced me to improvise on the fly. My stress level was an 8 out of 10, and I shouldn’t have to deal with that kind of pressure when I’m just trying to do my job right. It feels like there’s a lack of communication and support, which is really frustrating for someone with my experience.|1|2024-03-11 22:02:40
1540|66|12|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with my recent experience on route 12, which took a grueling 12+ hours and ended up being late, though I followed the schedule to the letter. To make matters worse, I encountered an assault that left me shaken and my stress level through the roof at a near 10/10. It’s disheartening that the Operations department didn’t provide adequate support or communication throughout the trip, which not only affected my safety but also my ability to deliver on time. With an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10, it's clear that something needs to change urgently, as this kind of experience is unacceptable in our line of work.|1|2024-04-26 18:57:20

To make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip that seriously rattled me, pushing my stress level through the roof at a staggering 15.4/10. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a dangerous situation, and despite having 9 years of experience, the overall trouble I faced was an 8.8/10.

1542|66|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I have to say, I’m seriously frustrated with the Finance department. Despite delivering on time after a grueling 21.26 hours on the road, I noticed that my pay for this trip was short by a significant amount. I’ve been driving for 9 years now, and I’ve never had this kind of issue before. It’s really adding to my stress levels, which already hit a 13.14 out of 10 during this trip. I shouldn’t have to chase down my hard-earned money, especially after a long haul like this one. Can someone please look into this and get back to me ASAP?|1|2024-04-29 08:06:10
1543|66|31|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 31, which took an exhausting 20.63 hours and unfortunately didn’t go as planned. Not only was the delivery late, but it also felt like a complete lack of support from your end; I had to deal with a ton of unnecessary stress that shot my stress level through the roof to a 10.19. I tried reaching out for clarification on some financial discrepancies, but all I got was the runaround. It’s really disappointing because I expect better communication and support, especially when I’m out there busting my tail on the road.|1|2024-05-03 00:31:21
1544|66|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Operations department. First off, the communication was all over the place; I didn’t get the right updates on traffic and weather conditions, which made the whole trip feel like I was driving blind. My stress level hit a solid 7.7 because I was constantly second-guessing my route. Plus, the load was not properly secured, so I was on edge the whole time worrying about potential damage or safety hazards. I’ve been in this game for 9 years, and I know how crucial it is to have reliable support from Operations, but this trip felt like a total lack of coordination. We need better communication and support to make our jobs easier and safer!|1|2024-05-04 17:56:04

On top of that, I had to deal with some serious issues during the trip, including an assault that left me shaken and stressed to the max, rating my stress level at nearly 11 out of 10! To add insult to injury, the overall trouble score for this trip was around 8 out of 10, which is unacceptable. I don’t feel like the Finance department is acknowledging the risks and challenges we face on the road, and it’s really disappointing to see that our concerns aren’t being taken seriously.|1|2024-06-11 21:23:59

The overall trouble score for this entire ordeal was an 8.8 out of 10, and I feel like the Finance team is completely out of touch with the realities we face on the road.

It's unacceptable that I had to deal with such a high level of danger and pressure, and then to have to chase after getting my expenses sorted out on top of that is just ridiculous. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.0, and honestly, it feels like the Finance team isn't taking our safety and well-being seriously. I need some answers and action on this!|1|2024-01-29 13:14:02
1548|67|12|1|1|I just wrapped up route 12, and while I got the delivery in on time, I have to say, the whole experience was pretty frustrating. The Operations department really dropped the ball on a few things. For starters, the routing was way off, which added unnecessary hours to my trip—18.19 hours is no joke! I also had some issues with communication; there were multiple times I tried reaching out for clarification on my stops and got no response, which left me feeling really stressed out—my stress level was an 8.3 out of 10! It’s like nobody in Ops is paying attention to the details that make a driver’s job easier. Overall, I’d rate the trouble score on this trip a 1.55; not terrible, but definitely not what we should be aiming for. We need better coordination and support on these runs!|1|2024-01-30 19:59:55
1549|67|8|1|1|I just wrapped up route 8, and I have to say, it was a complete nightmare. First off, the delivery was late, which is frustrating enough, but on top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken. My stress level was off the charts, hitting around 13 out of 10, and that’s not even considering the overall trouble I encountered, which I’d rate at about 8 out of 10. The Operations department really needs to step up their game—better route planning and more support for drivers in tough situations are a must. It’s unacceptable to put us in jeopardy like this, and I’m seriously concerned about our safety and well-being on the road.|1|2024-02-06 04:30:46
1550|67|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and I’ve got to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The trip took me an exhausting 21.15 hours, and honestly, the stress level was through the roof at a solid 12 out of 10. While I delivered on time and didn’t face any assault, the lack of support and communication really got under my skin—there were multiple instances where I wasn’t given clear directions or updates about traffic conditions and loading times, which led to unnecessary delays and confusion. The overall trouble score of 2.7 might seem low, but trust me, it felt a lot worse on the road. We need better planning and communication to make these trips smoother and less stressful.|1|2024-02-08 17:09:10
1551|67|8|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 8, which took me over 21 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I faced was through the roof, sitting at a 9.7 out of 10. The main issue is the lack of support and communication from HR regarding the long hours and the mental strain it puts on drivers like me. I feel like we’re just numbers in a system, and our well-being isn’t prioritized at all. It’s disheartening to see no real effort from HR to address these concerns, especially when we’re out there working hard and putting ourselves on the line. We need better support and understanding from the top down.|1|2024-02-11 00:19:13
1552|67|7|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 7, which took me over 12 hours to complete, and while the delivery went smoothly and was on time, I've got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses was way off; they shortchanged me by a significant margin, and it’s frustrating when I’m out there putting in the hard work. Plus, there’s been a lack of communication regarding my pay for the last trip; I still haven’t seen that processed, and it’s making budgeting really tough. I’m feeling pretty stressed about it, and with my stress level hitting around 7 out of 10 during the drive, I just need some clarity and support from Finance to sort this out.|1|2024-02-13 07:12:32
1553|67|11|1|1|I just wrapped up route 11, and I need to vent about some serious issues I had with the Finance department. First off, my delivery was late, which is a huge deal for us drivers, especially when I've put in over 11 hours on the road and dealt with a stress level that felt like a solid 11 out of 10. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which only added to my overall trouble score of 8 out of 10. I expected better support and communication from Finance, especially considering how much we rely on them to get our payments sorted and resolve issues that affect our safety and well-being on the road. It feels like they just don't care about the reality we face out here.|1|2024-02-18 03:47:11
1554|67|48|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent route 48 experience, which took an exhausting 9.58 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level up to a staggering 16.57 out of 10. It’s absolutely unacceptable to have to deal with such a dangerous situation while also worrying about financial discrepancies that seem to be affecting my pay and reimbursements. With an overall trouble score of 8.81 out of 10, I feel like the Finance team is dropping the ball on supporting drivers like me who are already dealing with enough stress on the road. I really need this issue addressed because it’s impacting my ability to do my job effectively and safely.|1|2024-02-23 05:21:55
1555|68|15|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 15, which turned into a nightmare. The trip took nearly 14 hours, and not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also faced an uncomfortable and dangerous situation with an assault from an aggressive individual at one of the stops. My stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 10 out of 10, and the overall trouble I experienced during this trip scores an 8.1 out of 10. I’m really concerned about the lack of support and communication from the Operations team, which made this whole experience even worse. We need better coordination and safety measures in place to ensure drivers like myself can complete our routes without unnecessary stress and danger.|1|2024-03-07 00:56:59
1556|68|20|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 20, and I've got to say, the Operations department needs to get its act together. While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the stress I faced during the trip was through the roof—around a 9 out of 10. The route was poorly planned, with inadequate rest stops and confusing directions that added unnecessary time and anxiety. Plus, I ran into some serious traffic issues that weren't communicated to me ahead of time, which just felt like a lack of coordination on your end. The overall trouble score might be low at 1.97, but the stress level I dealt with was way too high for what should have been a straightforward trip. We need better communication and planning if we're going to keep this operation running smoothly.|1|2024-03-10 02:21:16
1557|68|20|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent route 20 trip, which took a grueling 10.65 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I face a crazy amount of stress, rating an 11.8 out of 10, but I also encountered an assault during the delivery, which made the whole situation even worse. To top it all off, I’m really disappointed with how the Finance team has handled the paperwork and compensation for this trip, especially considering the trouble score I’ve had to deal with, sitting at an 8.02 out of 10. It feels like they’re not paying attention to the real issues we drivers face out here, and it’s incredibly frustrating.|1|2024-03-14 12:24:44
1558|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, which took a grueling 13.5 hours, and I gotta say, I'm pretty fed up with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on the road, but when I checked my pay for this trip, it was way off—like, missing overtime hours and added deductions that I never agreed to. I’ve got five years behind the wheel, so I know how this should work, and I feel like I’m getting shortchanged here. It’s honestly frustrating, especially after putting in that much time and effort, not to mention the stress of the drive being a solid 10 out of 10. Can we get this sorted out?|1|2024-03-15 08:29:30
1559|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, which took me a grueling 14.08 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have some serious concerns about the Finance department that need addressing. First off, the reimbursement for my fuel expenses still hasn't been processed, and I was counting on that to cover my costs. It’s frustrating when I have to chase down payments after working my tail off. Additionally, the lack of clarity around my pay rate for this trip is really making my blood boil; I thought we were clear about the rates, but it seems like there's been a mix-up. Communication has been lacking, and it’s adding unnecessary stress to an already demanding job. I’d appreciate some prompt attention to these issues because I can’t keep running on empty, both literally and financially.|1|2024-03-19 17:44:29
1560|68|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. First off, my delivery was late, which is never a good look for us drivers, and it really adds to the stress when you're trying to juggle everything else. The communication from Finance about my pay for this trip has been all over the place, and honestly, it feels like I'm just left in the dark. I clocked in over 20 hours on this run, and yet I’m still waiting for clarity on my compensation. It’s exhausting when you’re out there putting in the time and effort, and it feels like the finance team isn’t on the same page as the rest of us. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-03-20 17:50:35
1561|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15 and I’ve got to say, it was one of the worst trips I’ve ever had. First off, I didn’t deliver on time, and honestly, the stress level was through the roof at a solid 10/10. On top of that, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and furious. The Operations department needs to get their act together because this kind of oversight and lack of support is unacceptable; my overall trouble score for this trip was an 8/10, and I’m tired of feeling unsafe and unsupported while I’m just trying to do my job.|1|2024-04-20 06:04:34
1562|68|25|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 25, which took me almost 8 hours, and I need to bring up some serious issues I encountered with the Finance department. While my delivery was on time and I didn’t face any major threats, the stress level during the trip was pretty high at an 8 out of 10, and a lot of that came from the financial side of things. The reimbursements for fuel and tolls have been delayed, and it feels like I'm constantly chasing down updates. This has not only added unnecessary stress to my job but also messed with my budgeting. It’s frustrating to put in the hours and then have to deal with these financial hiccups on top of everything else. We need to get this sorted out so we can focus on driving, not worrying about payments.|1|2024-04-21 23:11:14
1563|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, and I gotta say, this trip was a nightmare. It took me almost 12 hours, way longer than it should have, and I didn’t even make the delivery on time. On top of that, I faced a seriously uncomfortable situation when I was assaulted during the trip, which cranked my stress level to a solid 10 out of 10. I can’t believe the Operations department didn’t provide proper support or prep for this route; the overall trouble score was off the charts at over 8! This kind of treatment is unacceptable, and something needs to change before this happens to someone else.|1|2024-06-11 10:49:47
1564|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up my route 15, and while I managed to deliver on time, I've got some serious gripes with the Operations department. First off, the communication was absolutely terrible; I had no idea about the last-minute changes to the drop-off location until I was already en route, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip of over 16 hours. On top of that, the load I was given was poorly documented, leading to confusion at the delivery point. I feel like if there was better coordination and clearer instructions from Operations, my stress level wouldn't have hit an 8.9 during the trip. It's frustrating to deal with these avoidable issues when I'm just trying to do my job right.|1|2024-06-12 04:20:02
1565|68|15|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up Route 15, which took me a solid 16 hours to complete, and while the delivery was right on schedule, I have to voice some frustrations with the Finance department. I noticed discrepancies in my mileage reimbursement; it doesn’t seem to reflect the actual miles driven, and I’ve been trying to get a clear answer for days now. On top of that, my last paycheck was way off, which is definitely adding to my stress levels—sitting at about a 7.4 out of 10 right now. I know we all have our off days, but this needs to be sorted out ASAP because it’s really affecting my morale on the road. Thanks for looking into this!|1|2024-06-19 04:32:32
1566|68|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and I need to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department. Not only was my delivery late, but I also encountered an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to nearly a 10. The whole experience left me feeling unsafe and frustrated, and I can't believe the lack of support we get out here. With an overall trouble score of over 8, this isn't just a minor hiccup—it's a huge problem that needs addressing. We deserve better communication and safety measures on the road, and I hope you'll take this seriously.|1|2024-10-12 09:36:38
1567|68|15|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on Route 15, which took me about 14.44 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time and didn't face any serious issues during the haul, I was surprised to find discrepancies in the mileage reimbursement calculation. They seem way off from what I actually drove, and after five years on the road, I know how crucial accurate reimbursements are to our earnings. This oversight not only adds unnecessary stress (my stress level peaked at about 8.65 during the trip) but also undermines the hard work we put in to deliver on time. I really hope this gets sorted out soon because it’s becoming a recurring issue that’s weighing heavy on us drivers.|1|2024-10-13 23:06:41
1568|68|20|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 20, and I have to say, it was one of the most stressful trips I've ever had in my five years as a driver. Not only was the delivery late—taking me over 11.7 hours—but I also faced an unexpected assault during the route, which pushed my stress level sky-high, probably around an 11 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball here; there was no clear communication about detours or potential hazards, which added to the chaos. On top of that, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8 out of 10, and it's unacceptable that we’re being put in these kinds of situations without proper support or guidance. This needs to be addressed ASAP.|1|2024-12-11 00:56:25
1569|68|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip was a nightmare due to poor planning and lack of communication. The load was packed way too tight, making it nearly impossible to make proper turns without worrying about damage, and I had to deal with some last-minute route changes that weren’t relayed to me until I was already on the road. This led to a stress level of 9.77 out of 10, which is just unacceptable for a job that should be straightforward. Overall, the trouble score was only 1.97, but it sure felt like a lot more when you're out there trying to navigate chaos. Can we please get better coordination and clearer instructions next time?|1|2024-12-15 00:44:25
1570|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, which took me over 18 hours, and I need to bring up some serious issues with the HR department that I can't let slide anymore. Despite delivering on time and having a relatively low trouble score, the stress level during the trip was still an 8 out of 10, mainly because of the lack of support and communication from HR regarding shift schedules and time-off requests. It feels like I'm constantly left in the dark about my rights and benefits, and when I try to get answers, I either get no response or vague information. This lack of transparency is frustrating and adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job, and I think it's time HR stepped up to improve their communication with drivers like me who are trying to do our jobs effectively.|1|2024-12-16 17:35:04
1571|68|15|1|1|I’m reaching out to voice my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 15, which took a grueling 14.5 hours and, to make matters worse, the delivery was late. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to a whopping 10.9 out of 10. I can’t believe the Finance department hasn’t addressed the compensation issues related to this kind of stress and danger we face on the road. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and I really feel like I deserve better support and acknowledgment from the Finance team, especially when our safety and well-being are on the line.|1|2024-12-27 13:36:19
1572|68|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to vent about some serious issues I faced. The whole trip took over 15 hours, and I felt like I was driving in a pressure cooker the entire time, with a stress level hitting nearly 9.6 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one; there were multiple times I was left in the dark about route changes and rest stop availability, which made it impossible to plan my breaks effectively. It’s frustrating to be out there, putting in the hard work, and feeling like you’re not supported by the team behind you. Overall, it’s not just about getting the job done; it’s about doing it without the unnecessary stress and confusion.|1|2024-12-29 01:11:39
1573|68|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, which took me nearly 15 hours, and I really need to voice some concerns about the Operations department. While I delivered on time, the stress I felt during the trip was through the roof—about an 8 out of 10. I encountered several issues, like outdated GPS directions that led me through a construction zone, causing me to waste time and adding unnecessary frustration to my drive. Additionally, the lack of communication regarding lane closures made it hard to plan my route effectively, and I ended up stuck in traffic longer than I should have. These kinds of operational oversights make it tough for us drivers to do our jobs efficiently without feeling overwhelmed.|1|2025-01-03 05:57:01
1574|68|15|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I faced during my recent trip on route 15 that took an exhausting 16.87 hours. First off, I missed the delivery window, which is frustrating enough, but to top it off, I experienced a pretty intense assault from an aggressive driver on the road that left me rattled. The stress level throughout this trip was off the charts, hitting around 10.5 out of 10, and overall, I’d rate my trouble score at about 8.1. I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball here—this is unacceptable for someone trying to do their job safely and efficiently.|1|2025-02-04 02:16:24
1575|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, which took me a grueling 18.84 hours, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got to voice my frustration with the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit multiple dead-end roads that added unnecessary stress to my already high level of anxiety during the trip, which was sitting at a solid 9.17/10. Plus, the communication about the delivery schedule was vague at best, leaving me wondering if I was going to make it on time or not. This kind of poor organization is not only exhausting but also totally avoidable. I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to make our jobs easier and safer.|1|2025-02-10 03:38:34
1576|68|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, which took me over 16 hours, and I've got to say I'm pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was a solid 7.6, mostly due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my schedule and route issues. It feels like no one is really looking out for us drivers; I’ve reached out multiple times about needing clarity on pay and benefits, but I keep getting the runaround or no response at all. It’s tough out here, and I expect better from a department that’s supposed to have our backs.|1|2025-02-13 16:35:55
1577|69|9|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent trip on route 9, which took an exhausting 16.3 hours and ended up being late. On top of that, I faced an assault during the drive, which just added to my already high stress level of nearly 9 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from HR during this time has been incredibly disappointing and left me feeling unsafe and undervalued as a driver. With an overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10, I truly believe this needs to be addressed urgently to prevent future incidents and ensure we get the necessary support when we need it most.|1|2024-01-02 19:27:47
1578|69|21|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Finance department after completing route 21, which took me 26 hours and went smoothly, by the way. I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip that don’t match what was promised, and it’s really frustrating. My stress level was pretty high throughout the ride, hitting nearly a 9, and to top it off, the lack of communication from Finance about these discrepancies has added to my overall trouble, which I’d rate at a 2.5 out of 10. I’ve been driving for 8 years, and this kind of mix-up is just unacceptable; I expect prompt resolution and better support moving forward.|1|2024-01-05 19:20:12
1579|69|9|1|1|I just wrapped up route 9, which took a grueling 19.6 hours, and I have to say, I'm pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the planning was a mess—there were multiple instances where I was given incorrect drop-off instructions that led to unnecessary detours, and the lack of communication made it tougher than it needed to be. Plus, the load I picked up was poorly secured, causing me stress throughout the trip, even if my overall trouble score isn't too high. It's disappointing to see such avoidable issues when we’re all working hard to keep things running smoothly. I hope you can address these problems to make future trips better for everyone.|1|2024-01-06 23:06:01

To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the trip, which only added to my already high stress level of 12.67 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from HR regarding such a critical safety issue is unacceptable and has left me feeling incredibly unsafe and undervalued as a driver.

1582|70|15|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns about my recent trip on route 15, which took an exhausting 15.11 hours and was anything but smooth. First off, I was late for the delivery, which is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the Operations department. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which left me feeling unsafe and added to my stress level, pushing it to a near-breaking point of 9.71 out of 10. Overall, this trip was a nightmare, with a trouble score of 8.06, and it's clear that something needs to change in how you handle these routes and ensure the safety and timeliness of deliveries.

1583|70|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, which took me over 12 and a half hours, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I have to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. The lack of proper communication regarding my stops and the uncertainty about loading times made this trip unnecessarily stressful, with my stress level hitting an 8 out of 10. I also encountered some pretty confusing directions that added to the hassle, which is totally unacceptable given my experience on the road. I know I can handle tough routes, but the disorganization on this one was a real problem that could have been avoided. This situation needs to be addressed before it becomes a bigger issue for other drivers.|1|2024-01-19 19:01:04
1584|70|24|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I faced during my recent route 24 trip, which took me over 10 hours and ended up being late—frustrating enough on its own, but that was just the beginning. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the drive that left me shaken and stressed out to the max, hitting my stress level at a solid 10. I’m just trying to do my job, and instead, I’m dealing with unsafe conditions and a lack of support from HR. With an overall trouble score of over 8, it’s clear that something needs to change.

1585|70|15|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up Route 15, which took me nearly 17.8 hours to complete, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my mileage reimbursement seems way off—I've been shortchanged on what I’m owed for this trip, and it feels like I'm constantly having to chase down these discrepancies. On top of that, the communication from Finance has been spotty at best; I sent a couple of emails about this and haven't heard back, which just adds to the stress of an already tough haul. I know the job can be challenging, but it’d be great if we could get a smoother process for handling these financial matters.|1|2024-02-06 20:35:17
1586|70|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, which took me over 15 hours, and I'm seriously frustrated with the Finance department. First off, my delivery was late, and it felt like nobody in Finance was on top of the paperwork to help expedite things. On top of that, I encountered some assault during the trip that left me feeling shaken and stressed out—my stress level hit a crazy 12 out of 10. The overall trouble I faced during this haul was an 8 out of 10, and I can't help but think that if the Finance team had been more organized and responsive, maybe I wouldn't have had such a hellish experience. It’s high time we address these issues before more drivers face the same problems.|1|2024-02-10 18:02:47
1587|70|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, which took me nearly 15 hours, and while I’m glad the delivery was on time, I have to say the Finance department has really dropped the ball this time. I’ve been waiting on my reimbursement for fuel expenses for over two weeks now, and it’s beyond frustrating. I’ve called a couple of times, and each time I get the runaround with no solid answers or timelines. It’s like they don’t realize how much stress it adds when I'm already pushing through these long hours on the road. Honestly, it’s a headache I shouldn’t have to deal with, especially when I’m just trying to do my job. Can someone please get this sorted out?|1|2024-02-12 16:23:41
1588|70|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Human Resources department. First off, I’ve been trying to get clarity on my benefits and pay structure for weeks, but every time I reach out, it feels like I’m hitting a brick wall—no responses or vague answers that don’t help at all. Plus, there’s been a lack of communication about our scheduling, making it hard to plan my personal life around work. With my stress hitting around 7.6 out of 10 on this trip, it’s frustrating to deal with HR's inefficiency on top of everything else. We deserve better support, and it’s time for HR to step up and be more responsive to our needs.|1|2024-02-14 22:03:10
1589|70|24|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 24, which took me over 10 hours and ended up being late for delivery. First off, the load was mismanaged, leading to unnecessary delays, and making the trip way more stressful than it needed to be—I’d rate my stress level a solid 10 out of 10. To top it all off, I actually faced an assault during the trip, which is completely unacceptable. I can’t stress enough how this situation not only jeopardizes my safety but also reflects poorly on our entire operation. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8 out of 10, and I really think we need to address these issues to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-03-02 18:13:38
1590|70|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, which took me just under 14 hours, and I need to voice my frustrations with the Finance department. While my delivery was on time and I didn't face any major issues on the road—just some stress, which I’d rate around an 8.5 out of 10—the financial side has been a real headache. First off, my reimbursement for fuel and tolls hasn't been processed correctly, and it's been weeks since I submitted the paperwork. On top of that, the per diem calculations seem way off, leaving me feeling short-changed for my time on the road. It’s seriously frustrating when I’m out here busting my tail to meet deadlines, only to have the Finance team drop the ball. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-03-05 03:38:41

Not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also faced an unacceptable level of stress throughout the journey, scoring a ridiculous 12.1 out of 10. To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the trip, which has left me shaken and feeling unsafe on the road. The overall trouble I encountered rated an 8.1, and I can’t help but feel that the Human Resources department has failed to provide the support and resources we need to handle such serious situations. I expect better from our company, and it’s high time that we address these issues head-on.|1|2024-03-08 05:08:36
1592|70|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and honestly, I need to vent about some serious issues I faced on this trip that the Operations department really needs to get a handle on. While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the stress level was through the roof, sitting at around 9.86 out of 10. The routing directions were not only confusing but also outdated, which made navigating through heavy traffic a nightmare and added unnecessary hours to my trip. Plus, the lack of communication regarding last-minute changes in delivery schedules had me scrambling and left me feeling completely unsupported. It’s frustrating when you’re out there busting your butt to meet deadlines, only to be let down by the very department that’s supposed to have your back!|1|2024-03-09 07:36:07
1593|70|15|1|1|Hey there, I wanted to bring up some issues I had with the Finance department after completing route 15. I managed to deliver on time, which is great, but I ran into some serious hiccups with my pay for this trip. The hours logged were around 19.18, but it seems like there's been a mix-up, and my compensation doesn’t reflect the time and effort I put in. This isn’t the first time I’ve encountered discrepancies with my pay, and honestly, it’s getting pretty frustrating. I put in a solid effort with a stress level of about 7.6 out of 10, and I'd appreciate it if we could get this sorted out quickly. Thanks!|1|2024-03-11 19:26:21
1594|70|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, and I can't believe the chaos I had to deal with; the operations department really dropped the ball this time. The delivery was late, which is frustrating enough, but to top it off, I actually experienced an assault while on the road—something that should never happen to any driver. My stress level was off the charts at nearly 14/10, and the whole trip felt like a nightmare, scoring an overall trouble level of 8 out of 10. I don’t know how many more incidents like this I can handle, and it’s clear that the lack of support from operations is making our jobs way harder than they need to be.|1|2024-03-15 03:24:29
1595|70|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, which took me nearly 12.8 hours, and while the delivery was on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my expense reimbursements are still pending, and it’s been over a week since I submitted them. On top of that, I noticed some discrepancies in my pay stub that don’t match up with the hours I clocked in. It’s frustrating when I’m out here busting my hump and can’t even get what I’m owed on time. The stress of trying to sort this out on top of my already high stress level during the trip is just ridiculous. Can we please get this sorted out ASAP?|1|2024-03-23 18:43:43
1596|70|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, which took me nearly 11.5 hours, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses hasn’t been processed yet, and it’s been over a week since I submitted the paperwork. On top of that, the mileage calculations seem way off, which is leaving me scratching my head when I look at my pay stub. With a stress level of 8.3 during the trip, I really don’t need this added hassle when I just want to get paid what I’m owed. Can someone please look into this? It’s frustrating and feels like I’m constantly having to chase down my hard-earned money!|1|2024-03-24 19:33:43
1597|70|30|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department following my recent trip on route 30, which took me over 10.7 hours and ended up being late. Not only was the delivery delayed, but I also faced an assault during this trip that left me shaken and stressed to the max—my stress level was at a staggering 9.8 out of 10. To top it off, I had to deal with the financial discrepancies that came after, which only added to my already high trouble score of 8.1. I feel like the Finance team needs to step up and address these issues more effectively, especially considering the challenges we face out on the road.|1|2024-05-27 19:47:51

Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced some serious stress on the road, hitting a stress level of 15.25 out of 10, which is just unacceptable. To top it off, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me feeling unsafe and unappreciated for the risks we take out here. With an overall trouble score of 8.81 out of 10, I believe it’s crucial for the Finance department to understand how these issues directly impact our work and morale. I’m really hoping for some accountability and a plan to ensure better support for drivers like me in the future.|1|2024-06-04 00:19:14
1599|70|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to voice my frustrations with the Finance department. First off, I was promised a certain amount for this trip, but my pay doesn't reflect that at all. It’s like they just pulled numbers out of thin air. I spent nearly 20 hours on the road, and with a stress level peaking at over 12 out of 10, the last thing I need is to be shortchanged. I understand that mistakes happen, but this is not the first time I’ve run into issues with my pay. Can someone please take a look at this? It’s really getting old.|1|2024-06-04 21:33:33
1600|70|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and honestly, I’ve got to vent about the Operations department—it was a real headache. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof at a solid 9.2 out of 10. The load I was given was improperly balanced, which made driving a nightmare and added unnecessary strain to my day. Plus, the GPS directions they provided were outdated and led me into a restricted area, wasting precious time and causing me to reroute. I can't believe I'm dealing with these avoidable issues after 10 years on the road. It’s frustrating when I’m trying to do my job right, and the support from Ops just isn’t cutting it.|1|2024-06-08 20:29:42
1601|70|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, and I need to vent about some frustrating issues I faced with the Operations department. While I made the delivery on time, the planning was a total mess—my route was not only poorly mapped out but also included unexpected detours that added unnecessary hours to my trip, which lasted over 15 hours. This increased my stress level significantly, sitting around a 7 out of 10, which is not ideal for a long haul. Additionally, the communication was lacking; I wasn’t notified about road closures or delays until it was too late, making it feel like I was driving blind. It’s time to improve the planning and communication so we can avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-06-10 03:45:46

To make matters worse, I found myself in a pretty dangerous situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which ramped my stress level to a whopping 10 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a high level of stress and danger while on the job, and the lack of support from Operations only added to my frustration, resulting in an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10. I urge you to address these issues seriously, as it’s not just about the delays, but also about the safety and well-being of your drivers.|1|2024-07-05 19:28:39

It’s been a nightmare trying to get my reimbursements processed – I submitted everything on time, yet I’m still waiting on payment for expenses that should’ve been cleared weeks ago. This is really frustrating, especially since I’ve got bills to pay and the stress level during the trip was already high enough at an 8.4. It feels like I’m just left hanging here, and it’s impacting my focus on the road. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-07-06 10:52:25
1604|70|24|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration after completing route 24, which took me over 13 hours and ended up being way late—clearly not how we’re supposed to operate. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level through the roof at a solid 12/10. The overall trouble I experienced was an 8/10, and it's unacceptable that I had to endure such a hazardous situation without proper support from the Operations department.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof, hitting a 9.7 out of 10. The routing was all over the place, and I dealt with inconsistent communication from dispatch that left me scrambling at times. I also had to navigate some poorly maintained roads that added unnecessary time to my journey, pushing my total trip to over 14 hours.

While my delivery was on time and I didn't face any assaults, the stress level was still a solid 7.4 out of 10, largely due to the constant confusion with my pay. I've noticed discrepancies in my mileage reimbursement and it seems like every time I check my pay stub, there's something off. It’s frustrating to have to chase down these issues when I’m just trying to do my job efficiently. Can someone please get this sorted out?

The stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 9.8 out of 10, and the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1—completely unacceptable.

I’ve noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip; it doesn’t reflect the hours I put in or the effort required, and it’s frustrating, especially after driving under high stress.

While I did manage to make my delivery on time, the stress levels were through the roof, hitting an 11 out of 10, and I can't shake off the feeling that the planning was way off. The route was unnecessarily complicated, and I encountered delays at several points due to poor communication about road conditions and stopovers. It feels like there's a lack of coordination and foresight when it comes to routing, which makes an already tough job even harder.

First off, the delivery was late, and I had to deal with a ton of stress—my stress level hit a whopping 16 out of 10. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault while on the road, which was absolutely unacceptable and left me shaken.

Overall, I would rate the whole experience as an 8.0 for trouble, and I feel like the lack of support and communication from Operations played a huge role in making this trip more difficult than it needed to be.

1613|71|19|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 19, and while I managed to deliver on time, I've got to say that the experience was pretty frustrating due to some recurring issues with the Operations department. First off, the route planning was all over the place, leading to unnecessary detours that added time and stress to my trip, which clocked in at nearly 11 hours.

On top of that, I faced an assault during the journey, which sent my stress levels through the roof at about 12.4 out of 10. It feels like the Finance team isn’t recognizing the toll this job takes on us, especially when our safety and well-being are compromised. With an overall trouble score of 8.1, it’s clear something’s seriously wrong, and it’s disappointing to see the lack of support when issues like these arise.

1615|71|21|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 21, and while I managed to make the delivery on time, I have to voice my frustration with the Operations department. The route was unnecessarily complicated, with frequent detours that added hours to my trip—totaling almost 20 hours! Not to mention, the lack of communication regarding road closures and construction zones left me feeling stressed out of my mind, rating a solid 12 out of 10 on my stress scale. I’ve also noticed that the load assignments have been inconsistent, making it hard to plan ahead.

While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress I endured was absolutely ridiculous, hitting a 9.7 out of 10. There were multiple instances of poor communication regarding loading times, which led to delays that could have been avoided. Not to mention, the last-minute changes to my route caused me extra mileage and confusion. Honestly, it felt like I was driving in circles without any support from the office.

I was on the road for nearly 24 hours, and while I made the delivery on time, it feels like I've been let down on the payment side. My stress level was through the roof at a 9.6, and it’s because I had to keep chasing down the paperwork and approvals that should’ve been sorted out before I even hit the road. The overall trouble score might be low at 2.8, but the constant back-and-forth with the finance folks has been a huge hassle and added unnecessary stress to what should’ve been a straightforward trip.

I felt like I was on my own, and the stress level was through the roof—like a solid 9 out of 10. Also, the overall trouble score was pretty low at 2.3, but that doesn’t change the fact that I was left feeling unsupported and overwhelmed.

While I managed to deliver on time with a decent overall trouble score, the stress level during the trip was way too high, sitting at an 8.16 out of 10, and I can't help but feel like that's a direct result of HR's lack of support and communication. I've had ongoing issues with my pay not reflecting the hours I've worked, and it seems like every time I reach out for help, I either get no response or the runaround.

While I managed to make the delivery on time, the whole trip was a nightmare—my stress level hit an 11.5 out of 10! This was mostly due to the lack of clear communication regarding the route changes and the poorly planned rest stops. I found myself running on fumes, both with fuel and energy, because the planned stops were either too far apart or didn’t have the necessary facilities to take a proper break. It's like no one in Operations considers the actual needs of drivers out there on the road. This kind of oversight is unacceptable and needs to be addressed before it pushes someone over the edge.|1|2024-02-09 12:46:11

However, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and stressed out, scoring a solid 9 out of 10 on my stress levels, mainly due to the lack of support and communication from HR. It seems like my concerns about workload and scheduling just fall on deaf ears, and it’s really affecting my morale.

While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was stressful, with my stress level hitting an 8.3 out of 10. There were several issues with the scheduling and communication; I was left in the dark about delays from a previous load, which really threw off my timing and made it tough to stick to my planned stops. Additionally, the lack of clear instructions regarding my drop-off point caused unnecessary confusion and added to the overall tension during the trip. I think we need to improve communication and planning to make these routes smoother for drivers like me. Thanks for taking the time to listen.|1|2024-02-11 18:04:07

The route was poorly planned, with several detours that added unnecessary time and frustration. Not to mention, I faced issues with the loading times at the warehouse, which were way longer than expected, leading to a total driving time of almost 17 hours. It felt like there was zero communication about the delays, and it really made for a rough time on the road. Something's gotta change if we want to keep drivers like me from burning out!|1|2024-02-27 22:11:31
1629|71|21|1|1|I just wrapped up route 21, which took me a grueling 31.4 hours, and while the delivery was on time and I thankfully didn’t face any assaults, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my mileage reimbursement is way off; I’ve submitted accurate logs, but it looks like they’re using outdated rates that don’t reflect what we actually agreed upon. Plus, I’ve been waiting over two weeks for my last paycheck to clear, and it’s super frustrating when I’m trying to manage my bills. The stress level during this trip was off the charts, and dealing with these finance issues just adds to the headache. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-03-02 16:50:43
1630|71|36|1|1|I just wrapped up route 36, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. The dispatch communication was seriously lacking—there were multiple times when I was left in the dark about my next stop, and the directions I received were sketchy at best, leading to unnecessary detours that added to my stress levels, which were already hitting a 7.4 out of 10. It felt like I was flying blind out there, and with a trip lasting over 10.5 hours, that’s just not acceptable. I shouldn’t have to waste my time trying to figure things out on the road when clear, accurate information should be standard practice. Let’s get this sorted out before it affects someone else’s trip like it did mine.|1|2024-03-03 21:18:31

Not only was I stressed to the max with a score of 13.61 out of 10, but I also faced an alarming situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which has left me feeling unsafe and unsupported. The overall trouble I encountered was an 8.06 out of 10, and I can't help but feel that the Human Resources department has dropped the ball in providing adequate support and resources for drivers like myself who are facing such extreme challenges on the road. It's frustrating to feel like my concerns are falling on deaf ears, and I urge HR to step up and address these serious issues.|1|2024-03-06 09:27:23
1632|71|21|1|1|I just wrapped up route 21, and honestly, I’ve got some serious issues to address with the Operations department. The trip took an exhausting 29.34 hours, which is way too long for what should have been a straightforward haul. The load was ready on time, but the routing provided was completely off; I ended up stuck in traffic for way too long, and the rest stops were poorly coordinated, leaving me scrambling for places to take breaks. My stress level hit an all-time high, and while I made the delivery on time, the whole experience was way more trouble than it should have been, earning a 3.39 on my trouble scale. This kind of mismanagement really needs to be addressed to avoid putting us drivers through this kind of headache in the future.|1|2024-03-12 11:56:35

Despite completing the delivery on time and not facing any assaults, the stress level during this trip was off the charts, hitting a 9.96 out of 10. I’ve been dealing with lack of communication from HR regarding my recent pay discrepancies, which has been incredibly frustrating and has added unnecessary stress to my job. It's been hard to focus on driving when I'm constantly worrying about whether I'm getting paid correctly. The overall trouble score I’m giving this situation is a 0.92 out of 10, but honestly, it feels a lot worse.

1634|71|23|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 23, which took a grueling 28.2 hours and was not delivered on time. The pay discrepancy I encountered has left me feeling undervalued after such a stressful haul, where my stress level peaked at a 9.4 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that the numbers aren’t matching up and I’m stuck trying to figure out if I even got compensated fairly for the time and effort I put in. This isn't just about the money; it's about feeling like my work is recognized. I really need this sorted out, because I'm not going to keep driving if the financial side of things continues to be such a mess.|1|2024-03-15 16:16:55

While I managed to deliver on time, the sheer lack of communication and support throughout this trip was off the charts, leaving my stress level at a staggering 9.5/10. I encountered multiple issues with load assignments that were incorrect, which wasted hours and added unnecessary stress. On top of that, the GPS they provided was outdated and led me to a dead-end at one point, making me lose precious time. It feels like the Operations team isn't in touch with the realities we face on the road, and it’s seriously affecting our efficiency and morale out here.|1|2024-03-20 12:57:54
1636|71|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was a nightmare due to poor communication and lack of support. I spent nearly 15 hours on the road, and the stress level was off the charts at around 8.5 out of 10. I encountered some unexpected detours that weren't flagged in the route planning, and it felt like I was left to figure it all out on my own. On top of that, there was a lack of clarity on my next assignment, leaving me hanging and anxious about what was coming next.

First off, their lack of communication is really frustrating—when I tried to get clarification on my recent pay stub, I was left hanging for days without a response. On top of that, there’s been zero support when it comes to mental health resources; after a grueling 21-hour drive with a stress level that felt off the charts, it would’ve been nice to have someone to talk to. It feels like HR is completely disconnected from what we actually need out here on the road, and it’s affecting morale big time.|1|2024-04-04 22:17:19
1639|71|36|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 36. While I managed to deliver on time after driving for nearly 14 hours, I encountered some serious issues that need addressing. First off, my expense reimbursements from the last trip were delayed without any communication, which left me in a tight spot financially. To make matters worse, I noticed discrepancies in my pay that I've tried to resolve multiple times, but each time I reach out, I get the runaround and no real answers. I get that things can get hectic, but the lack of support and transparency is really stressing me out, especially with my stress level already sitting at over an 8. It's just not acceptable, and I hope to see some improvements soon.|1|2024-04-10 17:53:53
1640|71|23|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 23, which took me about 24.5 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and I hit my timeline, I’ve got some serious issues with the Finance department that need addressing. First off, my reimbursement for expenses seems to be delayed again; it’s like pulling teeth trying to get paid back for fuel and tolls. I also noticed that my mileage calculations were off, which is really frustrating when I’m trying to keep track of my earnings. It’s stressful enough out there without having to chase down payments – I’m really hoping someone can look into this and sort it out ASAP. Thanks!|1|2024-04-13 05:21:02

While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of support from the Operations department was glaring. Communication was a mess—there were times I had to guess my next stop because the directions were outdated or unclear, and it felt like I was flying blind. Plus, the load was improperly balanced, which made driving a real headache and cranked my stress level up to 11.6! It’s disappointing to see these avoidable issues, especially when I take pride in my work and want to do my best out there.

1645|72|9|1|1|I just wrapped up route 9, and while I managed to deliver on time, I gotta say, the whole experience was pretty frustrating thanks to the Operations department. The communication was all over the place—no one seemed to know where the load was supposed to go until the last minute, which added unnecessary stress to my 16.43-hour drive. I also faced some issues with the load being poorly secured, which made me nervous on the road. I know my overall trouble score was low, but the stress level was a solid 7.5, and I feel like better communication and preparation from Ops could have made a world of difference.

First off, the mileage reimbursement I was promised hasn’t been processed yet, and it’s been over a week since I submitted the paperwork. On top of that, my recent pay stub was riddled with mistakes – I’m missing overtime hours that I clearly worked, and it feels like I’m chasing my tail trying to get this sorted out.

1649|72|43|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 43, and while I managed to deliver on time, I gotta say, the whole experience was pretty frustrating. First off, there was a major lack of communication from the Operations department about the load details, and I ended up wasting a good chunk of time trying to figure things out on my own. The routing was also a mess; I hit a couple of detours that weren't on the map, which jacked up my stress level to nearly a 9 out of 10. Plus, I noticed the truck wasn't prepped properly—there were some maintenance issues that made the drive a lot rougher than it should've been.

I’ve always been meticulous with my logs, so it’s frustrating to see discrepancies that make me feel like I’m not being valued for my hard work. It’s stressful enough out there without having to deal with financial headaches on top of it, and it really dampens my motivation when I feel like I’m being taken advantage of.

It felt like I was navigating a maze without a map, and the planning just seemed off. I also ran into issues with the load; it wasn’t secured properly, which made for a bumpy ride and kept me on edge the whole time.

It feels like no one in HR understands the pressures we face on the road, and when I reached out for clarification on some policies, I was met with vague responses and delays that only added to my anxiety.

I had to stop multiple times to readjust it, adding unnecessary stress to an already long trip of over 15 hours. This shouldn’t be happening, especially for a company that prides itself on safety and reliability.

First off, my reimbursements for fuel and tolls are still pending, and it’s been weeks since I submitted the claims. It’s frustrating because I rely on those reimbursements to keep my finances in check, especially after a long trip with a stress level of around 7.5, which is no walk in the park. On top of that, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for the last two weeks, which has added an unnecessary layer of stress.

The stress levels were through the roof, hitting a solid 13.65 out of 10, and it didn’t help that I experienced an assault during the trip, which made everything ten times worse.

I had to deal with all this chaos, and when I reached out for help, it felt like I was just getting the runaround instead of any real answers or assistance.

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the trip itself was incredibly stressful, with a stress level of over 11 out of 10. I encountered several issues that could’ve been avoided if the Operations department had done their job properly. For starters, the route they provided had multiple construction zones that weren’t marked, which forced me to make last-minute detours, wasting valuable time and adding to the stress. Plus, the lack of communication regarding load weight restrictions caused unnecessary delays at the weigh stations. Overall, the entire experience left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a driver, and I believe these operational oversights need to be addressed to prevent further issues in the future.|1|2024-02-26 10:35:32

The communication from the Ops team was pretty much non-existent; I had to figure out detours and traffic issues on my own. It’s frustrating when you have to deal with this kind of mismanagement, especially after 13 years on the road. I expect better support, and I think we need to address these operational hiccups to make our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-04-13 13:33:23

Despite successfully completing route 49 in just over 31 hours and delivering on time, I found myself dealing with a lack of support and communication from HR that really added to my stress levels, which were already sky-high at nearly a 10 during the trip.

1673|73|3|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the reimbursement for my recent route 3 trip, which took me just under 10 hours, and I completed it on time, by the way. Despite my punctual delivery, I've been waiting far too long for the processing of my expenses; it’s been a hassle just trying to get a clear breakdown of what I'm owed. The lack of communication and transparency is driving me crazy—I've sent multiple emails and left several voicemails, but I just keep getting the runaround.

While I managed to deliver on time, I’ve noticed discrepancies in my mileage reimbursement that just don’t add up; it feels like I’m being shortchanged for the work I put in. On top of that, there’s been a lack of communication from the finance team about these issues—I've sent multiple emails, but it’s like I’m talking to a wall. Given the stress level on this trip was already high at around 8.9 out of 10, the added frustration of dealing with these financial hiccups is really getting to me.

It's frustrating because I put in long hours, and I deserve to know how I'm being compensated for that work.

1678|73|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, and while I delivered on time, I need to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department that need addressing. First off, the load was poorly balanced, which made handling the trailer a real chore and added unnecessary stress to an already tight trip—my stress level hit around 7.5 out of 10. Additionally, the route planning seemed off, as I hit more roadwork and detours than usual, which could have been avoided with better communication about the current conditions.

First off, I was way off schedule, and the delivery was late, which is frustrating given my commitment to punctuality. The stress level on this trip was through the roof, sitting at a 9.2 out of 10, mainly because of the lack of communication regarding route changes and delays. It felt like I was driving in the dark without any support.

The constant changes in route directions were confusing and added unnecessary stress to an already long haul that took over 21.5 hours. On top of that, I had to deal with unresponsive dispatch when I needed clarification, which really cranked my stress level up to a solid 10.8.

First off, the route planning was a nightmare; the GPS sent me through some ridiculous detours that added unnecessary stress to my trip, pushing my stress level to an 8.7 out of 10.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I dealt with during the trip was through the roof—an 11.25 out of 10! The load was poorly organized and made it almost impossible to secure properly, which added unnecessary anxiety throughout the drive. Communication from Operations was also lacking; I didn’t receive the updated delivery instructions until I was already on the road, causing me to second-guess my route and waste precious time. I’ve been driving for 13 years, and I’ve never had such a frustrating experience. This needs to be addressed so we can avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-12-01 00:06:27

First off, the route information was way off – I ended up taking longer detours than necessary due to outdated GPS data provided. Additionally, the communication from dispatch was lacking; I tried reaching out for clarification multiple times, but it took forever to get a response, which added to my stress levels.

First off, the route directions were pretty vague, and I ended up wasting a good chunk of time trying to navigate around some unexpected road closures that weren’t communicated beforehand. It definitely ramped up my stress levels to nearly a 9 out of 10, and I feel like better planning and clearer communication could’ve made this trip a lot smoother. Also, the lack of timely updates about traffic conditions really didn’t help the situation.

1709|75|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, and I’ve got to say, the experience was a real headache. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress levels shot up to almost a 10 during the trip, mostly due to the lack of communication from the Operations department. I encountered several unexpected detours that weren’t communicated until I was already on the road, which wasted a ton of time and gas. Plus, the load was not properly documented, leading to confusion at the drop-off location. I’ve been driving for 8 years now, and I’ve never seen such a lack of coordination—this is not how we should be operating. I really hope this gets sorted out because it's making my job way harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-03-08 06:42:12
1710|75|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, which took me about 5.82 hours, and while I got the delivery done on time, I’ve got some serious issues to address with the Operations department. First off, the directions provided were outdated and led me into a construction zone that wasn’t even marked on my GPS, causing unnecessary stress and delays. On top of that, the trailer I picked up had a faulty brake light, which I had to deal with on the road—definitely not ideal when safety’s on the line. My stress level hit a 7.5 out of 10, and I ended up feeling like I was navigating a minefield instead of just focusing on driving. I really think something needs to change in how these routes and equipment are managed.|1|2024-03-09 22:47:36
1711|75|49|1|1|I just finished route 49, and I have to say, this trip was one of the worst experiences I've had in my eight years of driving. First off, I didn't deliver on time, which is becoming a frustrating trend that reflects poorly on us as a team. To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the trip, which left me shaken and stressed out—my stress level shot up to nearly a 10! The overall trouble I faced on this route was an 8 out of 10, and I can’t help but feel that the Operations department needs to step up their game. We can't keep putting drivers in these situations and expect us to perform at our best while feeling unsafe and unsupported.|1|2024-05-02 07:27:55
1712|75|25|1|1|I just wrapped up route 25, and while I got the delivery done on time, I have to say the whole experience was way more stressful than it needed to be. The Operations department really dropped the ball this time. First off, the load was poorly organized, which made loading and unloading a nightmare; it took way longer than it should have, pushing my stress level up to nearly an 8. Plus, the lack of communication about road conditions and potential delays was frustrating—there were some detours I wasn't warned about, adding unnecessary time to my trip. Overall, I can't help but feel like the Operations team needs to step it up to make our jobs smoother and less chaotic.|1|2024-05-02 15:05:34
1713|75|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, and I need to express my frustration with the Finance department. First off, the delivery was late, which really messes with my schedule and affects my pay. On top of that, I had an absolutely awful experience during the trip; I was assaulted, which left me shaken and stressed beyond belief—I was at a 9.7 stress level! The overall trouble score for this journey was an 8, and it feels like the Finance department just doesn’t get what we go through out here. I’m tired of dealing with these issues and need some real support, not just lip service.|1|2024-07-06 02:12:02
1714|75|32|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 32, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Operations department. First off, the load was improperly balanced, which made handling the trailer a real pain and ramped up my stress level to an 8.2 out of 10—definitely not what you want on the road. Plus, the navigation info they provided was outdated, leading me to some sketchy backroads that wasted time and added unnecessary wear to the truck. I’ve got 8 years of driving under my belt, and this kind of oversight just isn’t acceptable. We need to get our act together to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-07-07 06:24:16
1715|75|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, which took me a solid 29.12 hours, and while the delivery went off without a hitch and I kept my stress level manageable at around 7/10, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. For some reason, my reimbursement for fuel expenses hasn’t been processed yet, and it’s been way longer than the promised turnaround time. This is really frustrating because I rely on those funds to keep my operations running smoothly, and I can’t afford delays like this. I’ve reached out multiple times but haven’t gotten a clear response, which just adds to the irritation. Can someone please sort this out?|1|2024-07-11 14:08:02
1716|75|49|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 49, which turned into a nightmare. The trip took over 21 hours, and not only was the delivery late, but I also faced a seriously unsettling situation when I was assaulted at one of the stops. The stress level throughout this journey was off the charts—around 9.95 out of 10—and I can’t shake off the feeling of being unsafe while on the job. This kind of experience is unacceptable, and the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.06 out of 10. I really think the Operations team needs to step up and ensure we have better support and safety measures in place for drivers like me.|1|2024-07-27 23:56:45
1717|75|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, which took me nearly 24 hours, and I need to vent about the Finance department’s complete lack of communication regarding my pay for this trip. Everything went smoothly on the road, and I delivered on time, but I found myself stressing about the payment discrepancies and unclear breakdown of expenses. My stress level was already high at nearly 9 out of 10, and to add to it, the overall trouble score for this route was pretty low at just over 2, so the finance issues felt completely unnecessary. It's frustrating to put in the hard work and not get clear answers or timely compensation. Can we please get some clarity on this?|1|2024-07-29 00:37:13
1718|75|32|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about my recent experience on route 32, which took an exhausting 11.44 hours and ended up way behind schedule. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an unsettling situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which left me feeling extremely unsafe and on edge—not to mention my stress level was through the roof at a 9.5 out of 10. The lack of support from the Operations department during this ordeal has been disappointing, and I’m left feeling like my well-being isn’t a priority. With an overall trouble score of 8.05, it’s clear that there are significant issues that need to be addressed to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-10-02 05:05:44
1719|75|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and while I made the delivery on time, I have to say the experience was frustrating. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. First off, I received a last-minute change to my route that added unnecessary miles and time to my trip—totally unacceptable for a seasoned driver like me. Plus, the lack of communication about rest stop locations left me scrambling to find a safe place to take a break, which added to my stress level. With a trip clocking in at over 16 hours, I expect better planning and support. It’s tough to keep my head in the game when the Ops team seems to be operating on another planet.|1|2024-10-04 04:11:46
1720|75|1|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent trip, which took nearly 12 hours and ended up being late despite my best efforts. Not only was the stress level through the roof, hitting a 10 out of 10, but I also faced an assault situation during the route that left me shaken and feeling unsafe. I expected better support and communication from HR, especially given the circumstances; instead, I felt completely abandoned and undervalued. The overall trouble I encountered on this trip was an 8 out of 10, and frankly, I need to see some serious improvements in how HR handles these kinds of issues for drivers like me.|1|2024-10-14 20:48:02
1721|75|49|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration after completing route 49, which took an exhausting 29.7 hours and was far from smooth. Not only was the delivery late, but I also experienced an unsettling situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which definitely added to my already high stress level of 15.5 out of 10. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one; I had multiple issues with routing and communication that led to delays and a whole lot of unnecessary anxiety. With an overall trouble score of 8.8, it’s clear that something needs to change to ensure drivers like me don’t have to deal with this level of chaos on the road.|1|2024-10-17 18:24:32
1722|75|49|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent trip on route 49, which took me over 15 hours, and I still couldn't make the delivery on time. Things got out of hand during the trip when I faced some serious assault, which left me feeling extremely stressed—my stress level hit a ridiculous 19 out of 10. To top it off, the overall trouble I encountered scored an 8.88 out of 10, so you can imagine how overwhelming this has been. I feel like there’s been a complete lack of support from HR in addressing these matters, and it’s time for some serious changes to ensure our safety and well-being on the road.|1|2024-10-19 06:00:12
1723|76|46|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I encountered on my recent route 46 trip that took way longer than expected, clocking in at over 16 hours. First off, the delivery was late, which is frustrating enough, but to top it off, I experienced an assault during the trip, leaving me shaken and stressed—my stress level was through the roof at a 9.2 out of 10. This isn’t just about the hassle of being late; it’s about my safety and well-being as a driver. I can't believe the Operations department let this happen without proper support or communication. The overall trouble score was an 8.0 for a reason, and I really hope we can address these issues before they escalate further.|1|2024-02-02 14:53:24
1724|76|30|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 30, and while the delivery was on time, I need to bring up some issues I faced with the Operations department. The load I picked up was not properly secured, which made for a stressful drive—my stress level was around 7.7 out of 10, and I really shouldn't have to deal with that. The paperwork was also a mess; I ended up wasting a good chunk of time sorting through incorrect manifests and missing signatures before I even hit the road. With 9 years on the job, I know that efficiency is key, and this kind of oversight just adds unnecessary hassle to our already demanding work. Let's get this sorted out so we can keep things running smoothly!|1|2024-02-08 11:19:59
1725|76|46|1|1|I just wrapped up route 46, and I need to voice my frustrations about the Operations department. First off, the delivery was late, which is unacceptable after a grueling 16.86 hours on the road. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and added an insane level of stress—my stress level hit a 9.9 out of 10! I feel like the lack of proper support and communication from Operations put me in a dangerous situation, and the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1 out of 10, which is way too high. I really think we need to address these issues before someone gets seriously hurt or we lose more customers due to our delays.|1|2024-03-02 10:07:35
1726|76|6|1|1|I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on Route 6, which took me over 14 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the reimbursement for my fuel expenses was a mess — the amount they approved didn’t even cover half of what I spent, and I had to chase them down multiple times just to get an update. It’s really stressful when you’re already dealing with long hours on the road, and then having to fight for what you rightfully earned adds unnecessary hassle. I’ve been driving for nine years, and this is the kind of oversight that shouldn’t be happening. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-03-06 06:58:07
1727|76|47|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing Route 47, which took an exhausting 14 hours and was anything but smooth. First off, the delivery was late, and I can’t stress enough how that affects our reliability as drivers. On top of that, I was assaulted during the trip, which added an entirely unnecessary level of stress to an already challenging journey—my stress level hit a solid 9.4 out of 10. This whole experience has been a nightmare, and with an overall trouble score of 8.1, I expect the Operations team to step up and address these serious issues. We need better support and a safer working environment out on the road!|1|2024-05-05 02:48:10
1728|76|47|1|1|I just wrapped up route 47, which took me over 20 hours, and I've got to say, I'm pretty frustrated with how the Human Resources department has been handling things. Not only was my delivery late, but the communication during this trip was practically non-existent, leaving me feeling stressed out at a solid 7.8 out of 10. I expected better support for a driver with my experience, especially when there were issues that needed addressing. It feels like HR is not in tune with the challenges we face on the road, and that’s just not right. A little more engagement and responsiveness from HR would go a long way in helping us do our jobs more effectively.|1|2024-05-11 02:17:52
1729|76|46|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department following my recent trip on route 46, which took an exhausting 14.2 hours, far longer than expected. Not only was I late for the delivery, but I also faced an unexpected assault during the trip that left me on edge and feeling unsafe. The stress level was through the roof—I'd rate it an 11.5 out of 10—and overall, this journey was riddled with issues, scoring an 8.0 on my trouble scale. It’s unacceptable that the finance team hasn’t provided the support or compensation for these kinds of situations, especially when my safety and livelihood are at stake. I need this addressed ASAP!|1|2024-05-17 08:10:45
1730|76|6|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 6, which took a grueling 15 hours, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof at around 9.25/10, mainly due to the lack of clear communication about the delivery windows and poor routing instructions that made for a longer haul than necessary. It’s frustrating when I have to constantly navigate around unexpected detours that weren't communicated beforehand. I get that things can get hectic, but clearer instructions and better planning would go a long way in reducing stress and making our jobs easier.|1|2024-05-18 14:01:56
1731|76|28|1|1|I just wrapped up route 28, which took me nearly 20 hours, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. While I managed to deliver on time and had no major incidents, the stress level was higher than it should have been due to the lack of support I received regarding my scheduled breaks and the confusion over my pay rates for this trip. I also noticed that my concerns about equipment maintenance, which I raised previously, have yet to be addressed, leaving me feeling unsupported and undervalued as a driver. It’s disheartening when you’re out there working hard and the HR team doesn’t seem to have your back.|1|2024-05-24 11:01:37
1732|76|6|1|1|I need to bring to your attention the serious issues I faced on route 6, which turned into a nightmare. The delivery was late, taking a staggering 13.92 hours, and not only was that frustrating, but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to a near-breaking point of 9.37 out of 10. To add to that, the overall trouble I encountered rated at 8.05 out of 10. The lack of support from the Operations department made this whole situation worse; I felt completely abandoned when I needed help the most. This isn’t just about the delays or the assault – it’s about having the proper backup and communication to handle these critical issues on the road.|1|2024-07-11 03:20:49
1733|76|47|1|1|I just wrapped up route 47, which took me a whopping 14.35 hours, and while I’m glad the delivery was on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Human Resources department. First off, the lack of support and communication regarding route changes is getting out of hand; I felt totally blindsided by the last-minute updates that weren’t communicated until I was already on the road. It really cranked my stress level up to a 7.7, which is not cool for someone who’s been driving for 9 years. Plus, the way HR handles our concerns is frustrating—my previous complaints just seem to vanish into thin air. It’s like no one’s listening, and that’s really disheartening. We need better support out here!|1|2024-07-15 11:18:22
1734|76|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and I have to say, it was one of the worst experiences I've had in my nine years on the road. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a solid 10. I can't believe the Operations department didn’t give me the proper support or resources to handle this situation.

1735|76|28|1|1|I just wrapped up route 28, which took me about 16 hours, and I really need to address some frustrating issues I faced with the Operations department. While my delivery was on time, I had serious problems with the load assignment; the paperwork was incomplete and I spent a good chunk of time trying to figure out where my next drop-off point was supposed to be due to lack of clear instructions. I also experienced some serious communication delays which added to my stress level, sitting at about 8.4 out of 10 during the trip. It’s disappointing because I’ve been driving for nine years, and it shouldn’t be this tough to get basic support from Operations. Overall, I’d rate my trouble during this trip as low, but these issues really need fixing to prevent future headaches.|1|2024-08-12 15:47:49
1736|76|19|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 19, which took me nearly 13 hours—way longer than it should have.

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which added to my overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10. I feel like the lack of support and communication from the Finance team has made these issues even harder to deal with. I need better assistance and assurance from the company regarding these safety and financial concerns.|1|2024-08-18 20:13:55
1737|76|47|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department following my recent completion of route 47, which took me over 15 and a half hours to finish, despite getting the delivery on time. While I managed to keep my overall trouble score low at 1.13, the stress level was through the roof at almost 9.5 out of 10, largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR. There have been ongoing issues with my schedule and pay discrepancies that were promised to be resolved but haven’t been addressed, leaving me feeling undervalued and overwhelmed. I really think HR needs to step up and provide better support for drivers like me who work hard to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-08-25 12:29:30
1738|76|6|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 6 delivery, which took a whopping 16.6 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of proper communication and planning was evident throughout the trip. I encountered several unexpected detours due to poorly updated maps, which not only extended my travel time but also increased my stress level significantly, hitting around 7 out of 10. Additionally, there were issues with the load assignments; I was given conflicting instructions that made it difficult to navigate certain checkpoints. This kind of oversight really needs to be addressed because it affects our efficiency and overall job satisfaction.|1|2024-08-26 16:24:56

While I managed to complete the delivery on time after a grueling 20.24-hour trip, I was shocked to find out that my pay for this route was incorrectly calculated. The discrepancies in my mileage reimbursement and delays in processing my expenses have left me frustrated, especially after the high stress of the trip, which I rated around 7.94 out of 10. I’ve been driving for nine years and have never encountered such disorganization in the finance side of things. It’s really disappointing, and I hope you can sort this out quickly before it becomes a bigger issue.|1|2024-11-10 04:55:59

The stress level during this trip was off the charts, hitting a solid 10 out of 10, mainly because of the lack of communication and support from Finance when it came to resolving issues with my pay and reimbursement for expenses. I feel like I'm putting in all this hard work on the road, and yet I’m left dealing with unnecessary headaches from a department that should be helping us, not adding to our stress.

First off, the reimbursements for my expenses are still pending, and it’s been over two weeks since I submitted my receipts. It's frustrating because it feels like I’m constantly chasing down the paperwork and getting nowhere.

While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication about traffic conditions and road closures was frustrating as hell. I had to detour several times without any heads-up, which added unnecessary stress to an already long drive. My stress level hit a 7.8, and I can only imagine how it could have been avoided with better planning and updates. It’s like no one in Ops even cares about how these issues impact us on the road.

While I did make the delivery on time, the stress level throughout the trip was through the roof at a 9.6/10, mostly due to the lack of communication regarding last-minute route changes and the inefficient load distribution that made the trailer feel unbalanced. It’s frustrating to deal with these avoidable issues when I've been driving for nearly a decade and expect a smoother operation. The overall trouble score was relatively low at 1.24, but that doesn’t negate the fact that the stress and uncertainty could have been easily managed with better planning and clearer communication from the Ops team.|1|2024-12-22 05:23:08
1748|76|30|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the reimbursement for my recent route 30 delivery, which took over 14 hours. Everything went smoothly during the trip, and I delivered on time, but I’m still waiting for the reimbursement to show up, and it’s becoming a real hassle. I had to cover a few unexpected expenses along the way, and the lack of communication about when I can expect my reimbursement is stressing me out more than the actual drive! I’ve been driving for nine years, and this is the first time I’ve faced such a delay in getting paid back for my expenses. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-12-25 10:43:47

It took me over 12 hours to get the delivery done, way longer than it should have, and to make matters worse, I encountered an assault that left me shaken and stressed beyond belief—my stress level shot up to over 12 out of 10! I really feel like the Operations department dropped the ball on this one. The lack of support and communication throughout the trip was evident, and it contributed to an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10. This isn’t just about the late delivery; it’s about the safety and well-being of drivers on the road.

While my delivery was on time, the stress during this trip was through the roof—almost a 10 out of 10! It feels like the support from HR is lacking big time, especially when it comes to handling scheduling and communication. There were several times I had to chase down information about my next load and it felt like I was left in the dark, which added to my stress for the entire 14.5-hour haul. I know I’m not alone in this; it’s become a real issue for many of us drivers. We need better support and clearer communication to do our jobs effectively without all this unnecessary hassle!|1|2025-01-01 18:31:26
1751|76|19|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 19, which took me nearly 16.73 hours, and while I delivered on time and didn’t have any safety issues, I have to voice my frustrations with the Finance department. First off, I noticed that my mileage reimbursement wasn’t calculated correctly; it seems like they’re trying to nickel and dime us on every little thing. On top of that, my pay stub reflected an inaccurate amount for my overtime, and it’s honestly getting pretty frustrating to chase down these discrepancies every time. I’ve been at this for 9 years, and it feels like the Finance team isn’t paying attention to the details that affect our livelihood. Can someone please get this sorted out?|1|2025-01-02 11:23:00

To make matters worse, I encountered some aggressive behavior from another driver during the trip, which felt like an outright assault; it really shook me up and made the stress level shoot through the roof—honestly, it was a solid 10/10.

I’ve been waiting for my reimbursement for fuel expenses from the last trip, and it’s been weeks with no updates. It’s tough enough dealing with the stress of the job, which was a solid 10.2 for me this time, but having to chase down my money adds unnecessary pressure. I shouldn’t have to keep reminding you guys about payments that should be processed on time. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-11-13 11:53:30

First off, the directions provided were unclear and led me to take a longer, more complicated route, which added unnecessary stress to my drive—my stress level hit a solid 7.8 out of 10. On top of that, the load was not properly secured before I left, and I had to stop multiple times to check and adjust it, which wasted valuable time. This kind of oversight from the Operations department is unacceptable; it not only affects my efficiency but also puts safety at risk. We need to get our act together on these details to make our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-11-13 20:22:52

On top of that, the lack of communication from the Operations department made everything worse; I had no updates on the delivery schedule, which left me feeling totally unprepared and frustrated throughout the whole route.

The stress during the trip was an 8 out of 10, which is way too high, especially when I’m trying to do my job effectively.

This trip took me over 24.5 hours, and I didn’t make my delivery on time due to poor routing and a lack of proper communication about road closures. The stress level was pretty high for me, around an 8 out of 10, mainly because I was constantly trying to navigate around unexpected detours. It felt like I was just left to figure it all out on my own, which is not what I expect from a company that claims to prioritize driver support.

With an overall trouble score of just under 1, I shouldn’t feel this way, and I believe HR needs to step up their game to support drivers like myself who are out here working hard.|1|2024-03-16 08:39:17
1832|80|12|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 12, and honestly, I’m fed up with the way things are being handled by the Operations department. The delivery was late, which is frustrating enough, but to top it off, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken—talk about adding stress to an already overwhelming situation; my stress level hit nearly an 11 out of 10! The communication from Ops was terrible; I had no clear directions and was left hanging when I needed support. Overall, the whole experience was a mess and it’s unacceptable how it’s been managed. This isn’t just about a late delivery; it’s about safety and proper support for drivers who are out there grinding day in and day out.|1|2024-03-26 03:17:18
1833|80|29|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 29, which took me 6.79 hours and, thankfully, I delivered on time. However, the stress level during the trip was an 8.8 out of 10, and that’s just unacceptable. I had issues with unclear routing instructions that kept me questioning if I was on the right track, and the lack of timely communication about traffic updates had me stuck in delays that could have been easily avoided. Plus, the cargo load was not secured properly, making me nervous about safety the whole way. Overall, while I managed to get the job done, these constant hiccups are really wearing me down, and I feel like the Operations team needs to step it up to keep us drivers informed and safe out there.|1|2024-03-30 13:05:10
1834|80|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and honestly, I need to vent about the mess the Finance department has created. First off, my delivery was late—21 hours on the road, and I was stressed out of my mind, hitting a stress level of 14.5 out of 10, which is just ridiculous. On top of that, I had to deal with an assault during the trip, which only added to my overall trouble score of 8.1 out of 10. I’m trying to do my job and keep my head above water, but it feels like the Finance department is dropping the ball on support when we need it the most. It’s frustrating to put in all this effort and not have the backup we deserve.|1|2024-04-01 13:13:26
1835|80|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, and honestly, I need to vent about the Finance department. Everything went smoothly with the delivery, clocking in at just over 13 hours, but when I checked my pay stub, I noticed some discrepancies that just don't sit right with me. Despite my 10 years of experience, I feel like my compensation isn’t reflective of the hard work and long hours I put in, especially with a stress level that was through the roof on this trip. It seems like there’s a disconnect between what we’re promised and what we actually receive, and it’s frustrating. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-04-02 16:25:10
1836|80|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, and I need to vent a bit about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof—I'd rate it an 8.8 out of 10. The main issue was the lack of clear communication regarding the load details and last-minute changes to my route that weren’t relayed until I was already on the road. It felt like I was flying blind, trying to navigate unfamiliar areas with minimal guidance. Plus, the delays in getting my paperwork sorted at the pickup point added unnecessary pressure to my already tight schedule. It’s frustrating when I’m out here doing my job and the support just isn’t there. Something needs to change, or this is going to keep being a huge headache for us drivers.|1|2024-04-03 10:09:05
1837|80|44|1|1|I’ve just wrapped up route 44, and honestly, it was a nightmare. Not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also faced a seriously distressing situation when I encountered an aggressive driver who assaulted me on the road. The stress level throughout the trip was through the roof, I’d rate it a solid 9.7 out of 10. To top it all off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1—completely unacceptable! I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball on this one, and I need to know what’s being done to address these safety issues and ensure that drivers like me are supported better on the road.|1|2024-05-30 14:26:31
1838|80|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, which took me about 7.17 hours, and while I delivered on time, I need to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the load was improperly secured, which made for a nerve-wracking drive, and I had to stop multiple times to check on it—definitely not ideal for safety or stress levels, which were already at a 7.93. Plus, the communication about the drop-off location was all over the place; I ended up wasting too much time trying to figure out where to go. I’m just frustrated because with 10 years behind the wheel, I expect better organization and support from the team.|1|2024-06-01 03:37:40
1839|80|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and to say it was a nightmare would be an understatement. The trip took me nearly 17 hours, way longer than it should have, and I missed my delivery window, which is just unacceptable. On top of that, I faced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level through the roof—seriously, I was at a solid 10 out of 10 on the stress scale. All these issues combined give me an overall trouble score of 8; I can't believe the Operations department let it get this far without any support or guidance. This isn’t just about delays; it’s about safety and the well-being of drivers like me who are out here trying to do our jobs.|1|2024-06-11 00:22:43
1840|80|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and honestly, I need to vent about the Operations department. The trip took over 20 hours, and while I made the delivery on time, the whole experience was unnecessarily stressful—my stress level peaked at a 9.3 out of 10! I ran into issues with the load not being properly secured, which had me on edge for a good portion of the drive. Plus, the lack of communication about rest area locations made it hard to plan my breaks, adding to my frustration. The overall trouble score was low, but the stress they put us through is not worth it, and it’s high time someone addressed these operational hiccups.|1|2024-06-12 02:58:44
1841|80|12|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up Route 12, and while I delivered on time, I need to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a total mess—there were multiple detours that weren't communicated ahead of time, which added unnecessary stress and extra hours to my trip. Plus, the load I picked up was not secured properly, causing me to worry about safety the whole time. I get that things can get hectic, but I’ve been driving for 10 years, and this kind of disorganization is pretty frustrating. It’s not just about getting the delivery done; it’s about doing it safely and efficiently, and right now, that’s not happening.|1|2024-06-15 07:50:06

On top of that, I experienced an assault from an aggressive driver who cut me off and then proceeded to yell and gesture at me, which left me shaken and increased my stress level to nearly a 10. I’ve been doing this for ten years, and I’ve never felt this unsafe or unsupported on the road. The whole experience was a nightmare, and I’d rate my overall trouble score for this trip at an 8.

1843|80|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say, the experience was frustrating. The Operations department really needs to get their act together; my load was incorrectly documented, leading to confusion at the drop-off point. I wasted nearly an hour sorting it out, and that stress made the trip feel way longer than it should have—my stress level hit an 8.2 out of 10! Plus, I noticed the communication from dispatch was lacking, which didn’t help at all. I’ve been driving for 10 years, and I expect better coordination and clearer instructions from our Ops team.|1|2024-08-20 17:46:39
1844|80|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, and honestly, I’m pretty fed up with how things are being handled in the Operations department.

While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of timely communication regarding my schedule and the inadequate support for managing my stress levels during the trip is unacceptable. I found myself feeling overwhelmed, with a stress level around 8.3 out of 10, and it seems like HR isn’t doing enough to address these issues for drivers like me who are trying to stay on top of their game. I’ve been in this job for 10 years, and it feels like our concerns are falling on deaf ears, which only adds to the overall trouble of 1.35 I experienced this trip. We need better support and a more responsive HR team that actually understands the challenges we face on the road.|1|2024-09-25 21:12:57

While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip took an exhausting 22.34 hours—way longer than it should have, largely due to poor route planning and inadequate communication about the load I was carrying. The stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 9.8 out of 10, because I was constantly second-guessing if I was heading in the right direction or if there were any unexpected delays I wasn’t informed about. It’s frustrating to feel like I’m driving blind when I’m out there, and it’s not just about making the delivery; it’s about keeping my sanity too. We need to get our act together to avoid these avoidable headaches in the future.|1|2024-10-30 08:52:36
1848|80|15|1|1|Hey Team, I just wrapped up route 15, and while I delivered on time, I need to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was off; there were several unexpected detours that added unnecessary hours to my drive, making the trip feel way longer than it should have—18 hours is a lot to handle!

I’ve been driving for 10 years now, and I’ve never encountered such disorganization in scheduling and route management. We need to get it together before it affects our efficiency and overall morale. Thanks for listening!|1|2024-11-05 15:53:56

While I managed to complete the delivery on time and didn’t face any major issues on the road, the stress level was still pretty high, sitting around an 8.5 out of 10. I submitted my expenses over a week ago, and I’m yet to see any progress on my reimbursement. This delay is really impacting my finances, and it feels like I’m just getting the runaround when I reach out for updates.

1852|80|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say the experience was pretty frustrating overall. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one; the route was poorly planned, leading to excessive delays at a couple of stops that had me grinding my teeth the entire time. The lack of clear communication about the expected wait times made it even worse, leaving me in the dark and stressed out for almost 17 and a half hours. I’ve been driving for a decade now, and I expect better coordination and support from the team. This isn’t just about the hours; it's about making my job easier, and right now, it feels like they’re not doing their part.|1|2024-12-19 12:40:39
1853|80|12|1|1|I just wrapped up route 12, and I need to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department that made this trip a nightmare. First off, I didn’t deliver on time, which is becoming a frustrating trend, but what really pushed my stress levels through the roof—rated at a solid 10/10—is that I faced an assault during the trip. That’s beyond unacceptable and left me feeling shaken. Overall, I’d give this whole experience a solid 8 out of 10 for trouble, and it’s getting harder to stay motivated when I’m dealing with these kinds of situations.

The stress level during this trip was pretty high, around 8.67 out of 10, and it’s really unacceptable that I had to deal with this on top of everything else. The overall trouble score was low, but the lack of communication and timely payment is really dragging down morale.

1858|80|12|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 12, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I have to say the experience was frustrating due to several operational hiccups. First off, the load was poorly balanced, which made the drive a lot more stressful than it needed to be—my stress level was around 7.8 out of 10 for a reason! Plus, I encountered some serious delays at the loading dock because of miscommunication between the Operations team and the warehouse staff, making my total travel time nearly 12 hours. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with these issues when I’ve been driving for a decade and expect a smoother process. This isn’t the first time I’ve faced operational inefficiencies, and it’s really starting to wear on me. We need to get our act together to avoid these headaches in the future!|1|2025-01-12 14:04:54

1860|80|29|1|1|I just finished route 29, which took me about 7.25 hours, and while the delivery was on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my pay hasn’t been updated to reflect the extra hours I worked on this trip, and it’s getting really frustrating trying to sort this out every time. I’ve reached out multiple times but feel like I’m just hitting a brick wall. It’s stressful enough on the road without worrying about whether I’m actually getting compensated for my time!

While I made the delivery on time, the entire trip felt like a rollercoaster of stress, sitting at a solid 10 out of 10 the whole way. The dispatch was a mess; I was given outdated route information that led to unnecessary detours, which made the trip longer and more frustrating. Plus, I had trouble with the load documentation—there were missing papers that made the drop-off a headache. I’ve been driving for 10 years, and I expect smoother operations than what I experienced on this run. It’s really disappointing and makes me question the efficiency of our team.|1|2025-01-29 12:03:58
1864|80|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, and while the delivery was on time, I have to say the experience was far from smooth. First off, the load was poorly secured, which made for a stressful drive—my stress level hit a solid 7.5 out of 10 due to constantly checking my mirrors and adjusting my speed to keep the cargo stable. On top of that, the GPS directions were way off, adding an unnecessary hour to my trip and making me feel like I was driving in circles.

Everything went smoothly on the road—delivered on time and no issues with safety—but when I checked my pay for this trip, it was way off. The calculations seem messed up, and I feel like I’m not getting compensated fairly for the hours I put in.

1867|81|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and while I managed to make the delivery on time, the experience was nothing short of a nightmare. The Operations department really dropped the ball this time—there was a complete lack of communication about the loading times at the dock, which led to me sitting idle for hours and pushed my stress level through the roof at a solid 10.17/10. On top of that, the route directions were outdated and led me into some construction zones that weren't even on my GPS, adding extra time to an already long trip of over 22 hours.

1868|81|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I have to say, the experience was pretty frustrating due to some major issues with the Operations department. While I did make my delivery on time, the stress level was off the charts at an 8.4 out of 10, and that’s not just because of the road. The communication from Ops was lacking, especially when it came to routing and rest stop recommendations—there were no clear instructions on where to refuel, and I ended up wasting time looking for a decent place to stop. The overall trouble score was low at 1.3, but the stress I felt throughout the trip was unnecessary. It feels like the team could do a lot better in providing the right support and information to drivers like me who are out here trying to do our job efficiently.|1|2024-01-15 14:05:28
1869|81|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, and I’ve got to say, I’m really frustrated with the Operations department. The trip ended up taking over 23 hours, which is way longer than it should have, and we missed our delivery window because of some serious miscommunication about the load details. I also had to deal with constant changes to my scheduled stops without any heads-up, which made planning my rest breaks a nightmare and cranked my stress level up to nearly a 9. Honestly, I expected better coordination, especially since I’ve been on the road for four years now. It feels like the lack of organization is putting us drivers in a tough spot, and I hope things can improve moving forward.|1|2024-01-17 02:57:16

First off, I was late for the delivery, which is unacceptable and unprofessional, especially considering I had to deal with an assault during the trip that left me feeling unsafe and stressed out of my mind—my stress level was off the charts at 14.5/10! On top of that, the overall trouble I faced during this haul was an 8.3/10, which is just not right. The Operations department needs to get its act together because this kind of chaos is not what we signed up for, and it’s putting our safety and livelihoods on the line.|1|2024-01-17 18:30:19
1871|81|21|1|1|I just wrapped up route 21, and I’ve got to say, the experience was rough, to say the least. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress was through the roof, hitting a solid 13.5 out of 10 at some points.

While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip felt like a nightmare, with a stress level hitting a solid 10.8/10. The route was poorly planned, with unnecessary detours that tacked on extra hours to my trip, making it take nearly 15 hours. Additionally, communication was a mess; I had to deal with conflicting instructions about my stops, which added to my stress.

1873|81|29|1|1|I just finished route 29, and while I managed to deliver on time, I can't shake off the frustration from the way things were handled by the Operations department. The load was poorly organized, with inconsistent information about the delivery schedule, which made it hard to plan my stops efficiently. I spent way too much time trying to figure out the routing issues, which jacked my stress level to an 8 out of 10, and for a trip that took over 8.4 hours, that’s just unacceptable.

1874|81|21|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 21, and I need to bring up some serious concerns with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole process felt like a circus. First off, the directions provided were confusing, leading me to take longer detours that added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level was around 7 out of 10, which is not ideal. Also, I encountered issues with the load paperwork; it was incomplete and had several discrepancies, causing delays during pickup and drop-off. With a total of 26 hours on the road, I expected a smoother ride, but instead, it felt more like a battle with miscommunication and lack of organization.

I really think we need to sort this out for smoother runs in the future.|1|2024-02-15 11:05:24
1876|81|21|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustrations after completing Route 21, which took an exhausting 25.3 hours—far longer than it should have. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an alarming situation when I was assaulted during the trip. This incident, combined with the overall stress level I experienced—hitting nearly 14 out of 10—has left me feeling unsafe and undervalued as a driver.

First off, the directions provided were all over the place, leading me to take unnecessary detours that added unnecessary hours to my trip, making the total time clock in at a grueling 17.75 hours.

It seems like my pay for this trip hasn't been calculated correctly, and I'm missing some overtime hours that I clearly logged.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was uncomfortably high, hovering around a 7 out of 10, mainly due to the lack of support and communication I've been getting from HR regarding scheduling and my recent requests for time off.

First off, the communication is absolutely lacking; I had questions about my pay and benefits that went unanswered for days, which added unnecessary stress to an already demanding trip—my stress level hit a 7.4 out of 10!

While I managed to deliver on time after an exhausting 8.09 hours on the road, I’ve been dealing with some serious discrepancies in my pay. Despite following all the protocols, my last paycheck was short, and it’s causing me a ton of stress—my stress level was nearly a 9.3 out of 10 during the trip, which is ridiculous.

I felt like I was left to navigate everything on my own, with no support from HR when I needed it the most, especially regarding the long hours and lack of communication about potential delays or issues.

I faced multiple delays because of unclear routing instructions and issues with my load that weren’t communicated until I was already on the road. It felt like I was left to figure things out on my own, and it’s really disappointing considering how much we rely on the Ops team to keep things running smoothly. This isn't just a one-off issue; it’s a pattern that needs to be addressed so we can do our jobs without all this unnecessary stress.|1|2024-06-13 21:24:27

1905|81|28|1|1|I just wrapped up route 28, and I've got to say, the experience was pretty frustrating. While I managed to deliver on time, I faced some serious issues with the Operations department that need addressing. First off, the route details were all over the place, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip of over 18 hours. I had to deal with outdated GPS information that led me off-course multiple times, and it felt like I was navigating a maze instead of a straightforward route. On top of that, the lack of communication about rest stop locations left me scrambling to find safe places to take breaks, which only cranked my stress level up to a solid 12 out of 10.

1906|81|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, which took me a grueling 23.12 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel was way off; I submitted the receipts over a week ago, and I’m still waiting on that cash to hit my account. It’s frustrating to have to chase down money that’s rightfully mine, especially when I’m already stressed out to the max (my stress level was about a 10.5 during the trip). On top of that, the mileage reimbursement was calculated incorrectly, and I feel like I’m being shortchanged for my hard work.

Despite my delivery being on schedule, the lack of clear communication really added unnecessary stress to my trip, which I rated an 8.6 out of 10. I found myself constantly second-guessing if I was on the right track due to vague instructions and missing updates on traffic conditions. This shouldn’t be the case, especially since I’ve been driving for four years now. It’s frustrating to navigate on my own when I’m relying on the Ops team for support. I really think we need to tighten up our communication to avoid this kind of hassle in the future.|1|2024-10-21 02:13:31
1908|81|21|1|1|I just wrapped up route 21, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I have to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. For starters, the route was poorly planned, leading to unnecessary delays at a couple of stops, which upped my stress level to a solid 7.7 out of 10. I also faced issues with the cargo load; it was improperly secured, making the drive nerve-wracking and distracting. I didn’t feel supported or informed about changes made to the schedule, which added to my frustration.

This is getting ridiculous; I shouldn’t have to chase down money I’m owed when I’m out here working my tail off. Plus, I had to deal with some unexpected costs on the road that I can’t afford to keep covering out of my own pocket. I’m feeling stressed enough with a score of 7.8 out of 10 during the trip, so the last thing I need is to worry about getting paid for my expenses.

1992|84|8|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns regarding the Human Resources department after my recent route 8, which took an exhausting 18.43 hours and ended up late, causing added stress to an already tough trip. Not only did I face significant delays, but I also experienced an assault during the journey, which left me shaken and feeling unsafe. The stress level throughout the trip was off the charts, hitting a 10.95 out of 10, and overall, I would rate my trouble score at 8.07. It’s unacceptable that I have to deal with such dangerous situations without proper support or response from HR. I need better resources and a more proactive approach from HR to ensure the safety and well-being of drivers like myself.|1|2024-09-01 17:50:58
1993|84|1|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 1, which took me about 11 hours, and I’ve got to say, the Operations department really needs to get their act together. While I was able to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof—like a 9 out of 10! First off, the route navigation was a mess; I was rerouted multiple times due to outdated maps, wasting precious hours. Plus, the communication from dispatch was nearly non-existent, leaving me in the dark about some crucial updates. I shouldn’t have to deal with that level of confusion and stress when I’m just trying to do my job. It’s frustrating, and I hope you guys can sort this out before my next trip.|1|2024-09-02 21:03:17
1994|84|1|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 1, which took me over 16 hours and ended up being late. The delays weren’t due to my driving but rather the confusion surrounding the paperwork and payment processing that was supposed to be sorted out before I even hit the road. I had to deal with constant back-and-forth about missing paperwork that was already submitted, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip—my stress level was at a solid 7.3 out of 10 by the time I got to my destination. I’ve been driving for eight years, so I know how crucial it is to have everything in order, and this mess made the whole experience a headache. It’s frustrating when the finance team creates roadblocks that make our jobs harder instead of easier.|1|2024-09-03 14:14:48
1995|84|21|1|1|I’m writing to vent about the mess I had with the Finance department following my recent route 21 trip, which took an exhausting 26.56 hours and was anything but smooth. First off, my delivery was late, and that’s not just frustrating—it's unacceptable when we’re relying on timely deliveries to keep our clients happy. To top it off, I had to deal with an assault during the trip that cranked my stress level to an 11.74/10, and the lack of support from Finance in addressing that incident has been infuriating. Honestly, I’ve rated my overall trouble score at 8.14/10, and it's clear that the lack of communication and support from Finance is making an already tough job even tougher. I really need them to step up and handle these issues better because this isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the people working hard to keep this operation running.|1|2024-09-19 11:46:38
1996|84|23|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 23, which took me just over 21 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the constant confusion regarding my pay for this trip has been a major stressor—my stress level was through the roof at over 10/10 thanks to the back-and-forth communication and lack of clarity on reimbursement for my expenses. I submitted all the necessary receipts and documentation promptly, but it feels like I’m getting the runaround instead of a straightforward answer. This whole situation has really soured what should have been a straightforward trip, and I’d appreciate it if someone could sort this out before it gets worse. Thank you.|1|2024-09-20 10:29:21
1997|84|25|1|1|I just wrapped up route 25, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department because the whole experience was far from smooth. The trip took me over 12 hours, and I ended up missing the delivery window, which is unacceptable given that I’ve been driving for eight years and know how to manage my time effectively. There were multiple delays due to miscommunication about loading times and the lack of proper route planning, which bumped my stress level to a solid 7.5. This isn’t the first time I’ve faced these issues, and it’s really starting to wear on me. We need better coordination and support from Ops to prevent these setbacks in the future.|1|2024-09-23 11:17:14

First off, I was late with my delivery, which is unacceptable and could have serious consequences for our reputation. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip, which left me feeling unsafe and on edge for the entire 12.5 hours—I’d rate my stress level at a solid 9.8 out of 10. The lack of support and clear communication from the Operations team made everything even worse; it feels like my safety and well-being were not prioritized, and I’m left with a troubling score of 8.1 for the entire experience. This isn’t just another day on the job; it’s about our lives and livelihoods, and it needs to be taken seriously.|1|2024-10-14 12:32:04

The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit several unexpected detours that added unnecessary time to my trip, bringing my total to over 15.5 hours.

2000|84|8|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing route 8, which took me almost 16 hours—way longer than expected, and definitely not on time. To top it off, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and added a ridiculous amount of stress; I’d rate it an 11.9 out of 10.

Not only was my delivery late despite me pushing through an exhausting 8.49-hour drive, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a whopping 16.73 out of 10. It’s ridiculous that I had to deal with that on top of everything else, and the overall trouble I encountered was an 8.81 out of 10.

2002|85|31|1|1|I’m reaching out to raise some serious concerns about my recent experience with the Finance department after completing route 31, which took an exhausting 16.77 hours. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an unprovoked assault during the trip that left me incredibly shaken, pushing my stress level to nearly a perfect 10. On top of that, the financial paperwork was a mess, with missing reimbursements and unclear deductions that added more frustration to an already tough situation.

2003|85|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the entire trip took me over 14 hours, and the lack of communication about delays and changes in route really ramped up my stress levels to an 8.4 out of 10. I had to deal with multiple unexpected detours that weren’t communicated ahead of time, which made it a nightmare trying to navigate through traffic and stay on schedule. Plus, the load was poorly balanced, leading to a rough ride that I shouldn’t have had to deal with. All these issues made what should have been a straightforward delivery way more complicated than it needed to be. |1|2024-01-22 21:32:06
2004|85|44|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department following my recent trip on route 44, which took a grueling 22.42 hours. Not only was I late with the delivery, but the stress level throughout the trip was off the charts, sitting at a 14.26 out of 10. To top it off, I faced an uncomfortable situation where I was assaulted while on the road, adding to my overall trouble score of 8.14. I expected much better support from Finance regarding the compensation for the delays and the distress caused during this trip, but all I got were vague responses and no real solutions. This has been incredibly disheartening, and I feel like my concerns are falling on deaf ears.|1|2024-01-26 14:15:40
2005|85|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and I really need to voice some frustrations regarding the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip lasted over 17 hours, which is absolutely draining. The lack of clear communication about road conditions and unexpected detours added unnecessary stress to my journey—my stress level hit nearly 12 out of 10 at one point! Plus, the route planning seemed off; I wasted way too much time dealing with traffic and poorly timed rest stops that didn’t line up with my schedule. This could have been handled way better. It’s disappointing because it feels like the Ops team isn’t taking our feedback seriously or putting enough thought into our routes.|1|2024-01-29 10:14:54
2006|85|9|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 9, which took me a grueling 16.6 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress was off the charts, hitting a 9.4 out of 10, and that’s not something I take lightly. I encountered several issues that could've been avoided if the planning had been better—like route inefficiencies and lack of communication about road closures. It felt like I was driving blind with no support, which really added to my stress level. The overall trouble score was lower than usual, but honestly, it shouldn't have been such a struggle for what should’ve been a straightforward route.

2007|85|50|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 50, which took me about 25.9 hours to complete, and while I delivered on time, I gotta say, the Operations department really dropped the ball this time. The communication was lacking—there were several points where I needed clarification on delivery instructions, but I couldn't get a hold of anyone. Plus, the loading dock was a mess, causing unnecessary delays that jacked up my stress levels to a solid 7 out of 10. I get that things can get hectic, but it's frustrating to deal with when you're out on the road. This isn't the first time I've run into issues like this, and it’s starting to feel like it's a pattern. Please address these problems; we need better support out there!|1|2024-01-31 22:07:51
2008|85|44|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns regarding the Finance department after completing route 44, which took me a grueling 21.66 hours and was far from smooth. First off, not only did I fail to deliver on time, but the stress level throughout the trip was off the charts at over 10 out of 10—mostly due to constant delays and poor communication about route adjustments. To make matters worse, I was actually assaulted during the trip, which was completely unacceptable and has left me feeling unsafe and unsupported. The overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.07, and I can’t help but feel that the Finance department’s lack of attention to our needs and safety is contributing to these issues. We need better support and clearer communication to prevent these kinds of situations from happening again.|1|2024-02-21 07:54:08
2009|85|50|1|1|I need to raise a serious concern about the Operations department after completing route 50. While I managed to deliver on time, the level of stress I faced during the trip was unnecessarily high, hitting an 8.5 out of 10. The communication from Operations was lacking; I encountered multiple delays due to incorrect routing information that wasted precious time and left me feeling frustrated. Additionally, the lack of clear instructions regarding loading and unloading at the docks added to the chaos, making what should have been a smooth delivery turn into a real headache.

The trip took me over 11 hours, and I faced multiple issues with route planning and communication that really added unnecessary stress to my day—my stress level hit about 7.6 out of 10 at one point.

2011|85|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and while the delivery went smoothly and I stayed on schedule, I really need to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Finance department. It seems like my expense reimbursements are all over the place—some of my fuel costs from the last trip still haven’t been processed, and there are discrepancies in the mileage reimbursements that don't add up. I’ve tried reaching out for clarification, but responses have been slow, and it’s frustrating, especially after putting in over 11 hours on the road. It’s starting to feel like I'm doing double the work just to get my finances sorted out, and that’s adding unnecessary stress to my job.|1|2024-02-29 16:17:52
2012|85|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent experience on route 38, which took an exhausting 16.58 hours—definitely not what I signed up for. Not only did I miss my delivery deadline, but I also had to deal with an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out of my mind, with a stress level hitting 11/10.

2013|85|34|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 34, which took me almost 24 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the payment discrepancies I encountered have been really irritating. It seems like there’s been a mix-up with my mileage pay, and I haven’t received the correct reimbursements for my fuel expenses either. It’s incredibly stressful when you’re trying to stay focused on the road, and then you have to deal with this financial nonsense on top of everything else. I just want to get paid what I'm owed without all this hassle, so I’d appreciate it if you could look into this situation ASAP.|1|2024-03-10 08:41:02
2014|85|38|1|1|I just wrapped up route 38, which took me over 20 hours, and I gotta say, the Operations department really dropped the ball this time. While I did make the delivery on time, the planning was seriously lacking—there were multiple points along the way where I ran into unexpected road closures and detours that weren’t communicated to me in advance, leading to unnecessary stress and a higher-than-usual stress level of about 7.3. Plus, I had to waste time figuring out alternate routes that should have been accounted for in the trip planning.

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 10.8 out of 10. Not only do I feel unsafe on the road, but it’s also incredibly stressful to deal with financial issues when they should be the least of my worries. The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and I expected better communication and support from Finance, especially given the circumstances. It’s time for some serious attention to these issues before they escalate further.|1|2024-03-23 02:07:26
2016|85|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, which took me over 17 hours, and I really need to vent about some issues I've been having with the Human Resources department. Despite delivering on time, I've been feeling frustrated with the lack of support when it comes to addressing my stress levels, which peaked at a 9.1 during the trip. It seems like HR is completely out of touch with what we drivers go through on the road. I’ve tried reaching out for help with some concerns regarding workload and mental health resources, but it's like I'm talking to a wall. The overall trouble score for this trip was low, but the stress is wearing me down, and I feel like HR isn’t taking our well-being seriously. Something's gotta change!|1|2024-03-25 17:01:48
2017|85|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, which took me about 17.5 hours to complete, and while I did manage to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Operations department. First off, the route was poorly planned—there were multiple points where I hit unexpected traffic and construction delays that could've been avoided with better communication. Also, the load was not properly secured, which made for a bumpy ride and definitely raised my stress level to about a 7.3 out of 10. It feels like the folks in Operations are out of touch with what we actually deal with on the road, and it’s frustrating to think that these kinds of oversights could lead to bigger problems down the line.|1|2024-03-26 20:02:15
2018|85|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and I’ve got to say, the experience was beyond frustrating.

To make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to an 11 out of 10—completely unacceptable.

While I managed to deliver on time, I spent a grueling 15 hours on the road, and the stress level was off the charts—9.4 out of 10! The route was poorly planned, with vague directions and unclear stop instructions that made me waste a ton of time figuring things out. Plus, there were last-minute changes that I wasn’t informed about until I was already on the way, which only added to the chaos and frustration. I get that things can get hectic, but this is becoming a pattern, and it’s really affecting my job satisfaction and overall morale.

The route was unnecessarily convoluted, which added to my stress level, sitting at an 8.26 out of 10. The GPS directions were off, leading me to a dead-end that wasted precious time, and there was a lack of communication regarding the delivery windows that made scheduling a nightmare. Plus, I noticed that the truck wasn’t loaded properly, causing me to adjust my driving to compensate for the uneven weight distribution. This isn’t the first time I’ve faced these issues, and it’s really starting to take a toll on my work experience. I hope something changes soon because this is getting old.|1|2024-05-09 07:51:17
2021|85|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The trip took an exhausting 20.6 hours, and I felt like I was running in circles trying to get clear communication regarding my load and drop-off instructions. There were several instances where I was left hanging with no updates, which added unnecessary stress to an already lengthy drive—my stress level hit a 7.8 out of 10! The lack of organization really impacted my ability to focus on the road, and I believe better coordination and communication can prevent these issues from happening again.

2022|85|38|1|1|I’m writing to raise some serious concerns about my recent experience on route 38.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof at an 11 out of 10, and I can't shake off how unorganized the Operations department seems to be. There were multiple instances where I was given conflicting information about my stops, leading to unnecessary delays and confusion, which definitely contributed to my stress.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof—an 8.5 out of 10! The communication was terrible; I didn’t receive critical updates about road closures until I was already on the highway, which forced me to reroute and waste precious time.

First off, the load was poorly balanced, making it a real challenge to drive, especially when I hit those windy stretches.

I've submitted my receipts twice now, and they keep claiming they didn't receive them, which is just unacceptable. This whole situation has added unnecessary stress to my job, pushing my stress level to a solid 9.35 out of 10.

I’ve been trying to sort out some discrepancies with my pay and benefits for weeks now, and every time I reach out, it feels like I'm just hitting a brick wall.

2032|85|44|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 44, which took an exhausting 20.41 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I faced a serious issue when I was assaulted during the trip, which pushed my stress level through the roof at an 11.34 out of 10. The lack of communication and support from Operations only added to my overall trouble score of 8.11. It's unacceptable that drivers like me have to deal with these kinds of problems without any proper backup or guidance from the team. We need better planning and a more responsive support system to ensure our safety and timely deliveries.|1|2024-08-11 21:44:10
2033|85|50|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department following my recent trip on route 50, which took an exhausting 33 hours to complete—way longer than it should have. Not only was the delivery late, but the lack of clear communication regarding payment for the extra hours has left me feeling undervalued and stressed out, pushing my stress level to a 9.4 out of 10 during the trip. I really expected better from the Finance team, especially since I’ve been driving for seven years and have always handled my duties professionally. It’s disheartening to feel like my hard work goes unnoticed and unappreciated.|1|2024-08-14 02:54:30
2034|85|50|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 50, which took me a grueling 25.35 hours, and I need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of proper communication regarding road conditions and unexpected detours really added unnecessary stress to the trip, pushing my stress level to a solid 7.2 out of 10. I also had issues with the routing software being outdated, which led me to some questionable routes that wasted both time and fuel. It’s frustrating that after seven years on the road, I still have to deal with these avoidable hiccups. We need better support and tools to do our jobs efficiently!|1|2024-08-15 09:48:25

The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.07, and honestly, it’s unacceptable that drivers like myself should have to deal with such dangerous situations and poor planning. I believe it’s high time the Operations team takes a good look at how routes are managed and prioritizes driver safety and timely deliveries.|1|2024-08-27 18:09:29
2036|85|28|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 28, and I really need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was off the charts—almost a 9.2 out of 10! The main issue was a lack of communication regarding last-minute route changes and unclear instructions about the delivery location, which really messed with my head and added unnecessary pressure. Plus, the paperwork was a total mess; I had to waste precious time trying to sort out discrepancies that should have been handled before I even hit the road. It feels like the Operations team is seriously dropping the ball, and it’s making our jobs a lot harder than they need to be.|1|2024-09-03 18:08:36
2037|85|50|1|1|I just finished up route 50, which took me about 20.82 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and I was on time, I have to say the Finance department is really dropping the ball. I’ve been waiting way too long for my reimbursement from the last trip, and it’s starting to get frustrating. I keep reaching out, but I’m getting the runaround with no clear answers or any sense of urgency to resolve it. It’s hard enough out here on the road without having to stress about getting paid for the work I’ve done. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-09-07 18:46:38
2038|85|38|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department following my recent trip on route 38, which took nearly 15 hours and ended up being late for delivery. Not only was the stress level through the roof—an 11 out of 10—but I also experienced an assault during the trip that was completely mishandled. I reached out to HR for support, but instead of receiving any help, I felt like I was being brushed off. With an overall trouble score of over 8, this kind of treatment is unacceptable and puts not only my safety but also my job at risk. I need HR to step up and take these concerns seriously before something worse happens.|1|2024-09-16 13:45:20

Despite my solid 7 years on the road, I felt completely unsupported when I reached out for help regarding scheduling issues and the lack of communication about my route changes. The stress level during this trip was through the roof, hitting a 10.4 out of 10, and it seems like HR just doesn't get how tough it can be out here. I really need HR to step up their game and provide better support for drivers like me who are just trying to do our job without all the extra headaches.|1|2024-09-20 16:03:46
2040|85|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess—there were several detours that added unnecessary hours to my trip, making an already long 20-hour haul feel even longer. The stress level was through the roof, sitting at an 8.27 out of 10, and I felt like I was navigating a maze rather than a straightforward delivery route. Plus, the communication from Ops was practically non-existent; I had no clue about traffic updates or road closures, which really knocked my rhythm off. It’s frustrating to work so hard only to feel unsupported by the very team that’s supposed to have our backs.|1|2024-09-22 18:23:34

Not only was my delivery late, but I also had to deal with some serious stress during the trip, hitting a 11.5 on the stress scale due to an assault I faced along the way. It feels like the Finance team is completely out of touch with the realities drivers face. Their lack of support and understanding for what we go through is unacceptable, especially when my overall trouble score was an 8.2.

2042|85|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, and I've got to say, the experience was pretty rough, and I feel the need to voice my concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress was through the roof, hitting a solid 9.5 out of 10. I ran into some serious issues with the dispatching process; it seemed like there was a lack of communication regarding my pick-up times and the load details, which left me scrambling at the last minute. Plus, the route planning was off—there were road closures that weren’t communicated beforehand, adding unnecessary delays and frustration. It’s disappointing because I’ve been driving for seven years, and I expect better support from the team.|1|2024-10-22 13:30:07
2043|85|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I’ve got to voice my frustrations about the Operations department. The route was supposed to be straightforward, but the lack of clear instructions led to a lot of unnecessary stress—my stress level hit an 8 out of 10! I encountered multiple delays due to poorly planned stops and insufficient communication about road conditions, which made the 13.3-hour trip feel even longer. It’s hard to keep a cool head when you’re left in the dark about what to expect.

2044|85|13|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns about the Human Resources department after my recent trip on Route 13, which ended up being a complete nightmare. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, and the stress I experienced during the trip was through the roof—I'd rate it a solid 10 out of 10. To make matters worse, I faced an assault while on the road, which should never happen to anyone, let alone a professional driver. I feel like the HR team has dropped the ball in addressing safety protocols and support for drivers like me, and it’s incredibly frustrating to see such a lack of concern for our well-being.

2045|85|44|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 44 delivery. While I did manage to complete the trip on time, the entire experience was incredibly stressful, with a stress level hitting a 9.67 out of 10. I encountered multiple issues that could have been avoided, such as unclear routing instructions and insufficient communication about loading times, which caused unnecessary delays. It felt like I was left to figure things out on my own in a time-sensitive situation, and that really added to my overall trouble score of 2.61.

While I did manage to complete the trip on time, the planning and communication leading up to it were seriously lacking. I spent an exhausting 20.23 hours on the road, and the lack of accurate route information and the last-minute changes left me feeling pretty stressed (about a 7.5 on my scale). On top of that, the paperwork wasn’t ready when I arrived at the drop-off, which just added to the chaos. I get that things happen, but we need better coordination to avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-12-14 20:48:36
2047|85|38|1|1|I just wrapped up route 38, and honestly, I need to get some things off my chest about the Operations department. First off, the delivery was way late, and it’s frustrating when I’m busting my tail out there for nothing. To top it off, I faced some pretty intense stress during the trip—my stress level was through the roof at nearly 12.6 out of 10! And if that wasn’t enough, I actually experienced an assault during my drive, which is just unacceptable. All of these issues combined have left me with a trouble score of over 8—this isn't just a minor hiccup; it’s a serious problem that needs attention. We need better support and communication from Operations to ensure we’re safe and on track!|1|2024-12-19 18:00:15
2048|85|9|1|1|I just wrapped up route 9, which took me a grueling 13.9 hours, and I need to bring some serious issues to your attention regarding the Finance department. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.5/10, mainly because of the constant back-and-forth with finance over missing reimbursements for my fuel and tolls. It’s frustrating to complete my job efficiently only to have to chase down payment for expenses that should have been sorted out beforehand. This should be a smooth process, but instead, it feels like I'm running in circles. I really hope you can address this so I can focus on driving rather than dealing with finance headaches.|1|2024-12-26 00:52:39
2049|86|20|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on Route 20, which took over 13 hours and was far from smooth. Not only was I late on delivery, but I also faced a distressing situation when I was assaulted during the trip, which pushed my stress level to a solid 10. The lack of communication and support from Operations made it even worse, leaving me feeling stranded and overwhelmed.

2050|86|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and while I made the delivery on time, I gotta say the whole experience was pretty frustrating. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. First off, the route directions I received were outdated and led me into some road closures that wasted a lot of my time—about an hour, to be exact. On top of that, my load was poorly secured, and I had to stop halfway through to fix it, adding unnecessary stress to an already tough trip. With a stress level of 9 out of 10, it felt like I was juggling fire while driving! This kind of mismanagement is unacceptable, and I really hope something changes because it’s putting drivers like me in a tough spot.|1|2024-01-27 16:26:32
2051|86|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit several unexpected detours that added unnecessary stress to my trip, and with a stress level of 8.25, it was far from a smooth ride. Plus, I encountered delays due to poorly coordinated loading times at the dock, which wasted precious hours. I’ve been driving for 7 years, and I can tell you that communication and planning play a huge role in keeping things efficient, but it feels like that’s been lacking lately. This isn’t just about me; it affects everyone on the road and our overall performance. Let's get it together!|1|2024-02-02 07:17:56
2052|86|16|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 16, which took me over 22 hours, and I need to vent about the Finance department's screw-ups. While I delivered on time and didn’t face any major issues on the road, I’ve been getting the runaround regarding my mileage reimbursement and the recent pay discrepancies. The numbers just don’t add up, and it’s super frustrating trying to get clarity. I shouldn’t have to chase people down for answers, especially when I’m out there busting my butt on the road.

To top it off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.14, indicating just how chaotic and unsafe things got.

2054|86|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced during the trip. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was a nightmare—my stress level was through the roof at a 10.2 out of 10, and it shouldn't have been that way. The Operations department dropped the ball big time; there were multiple miscommunications about pickup times which caused me to sit and wait for hours with no updates. On top of that, the trailer wasn’t loaded properly, leading to a bumpy ride that made me question the integrity of the cargo. This kind of disorganization isn’t just frustrating, it can compromise safety and efficiency. We really need to get our act together on this!|1|2024-02-21 17:59:19
2055|86|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, which took me about 7.68 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say the whole experience was pretty frustrating. First off, the communication from the Operations department was lacking; I didn’t receive the necessary updates about the traffic conditions until I was already on the road, which added unnecessary stress. Also, the load wasn’t secured properly, causing it to shift during transit and making me really nervous about potential damage or safety issues. I get that things can get hectic, but for a driver like me with seven years under my belt, these kinds of oversights shouldn’t be happening. It feels like there’s a disconnect somewhere, and it’s really affecting my job satisfaction and performance.|1|2024-02-22 03:54:50

It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a dangerous situation without proper support or guidance from HR.

2057|86|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, which took me over 12 and a half hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, it was far from a smooth ride. First off, the directions provided by the Operations department were confusing and led me through some unnecessary detours, adding to my stress level, which was already high at nearly 9 out of 10. It's frustrating when I have to waste time trying to figure out where to go instead of focusing on driving. Plus, the communication about the delivery window could use some improvement; I felt like I was left in the dark about any changes or expectations. Overall, my trouble score was low, but the stress and confusion could have been easily avoided with better planning and clearer instructions from Ops.|1|2024-04-15 12:30:06

The stress level was through the roof, hitting an 11 out of 10, and honestly, I’m not sure how much more of this I can take. The Operations department needs to seriously reevaluate their planning and support for drivers like me; I shouldn’t have to worry about my safety or be pushed to the brink like this. My overall trouble score for this trip is an 8 out of 10, and that’s just unacceptable.|1|2024-05-19 05:23:06

2060|86|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and I really need to address some issues with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole trip was a bit of a nightmare. My stress level was sitting around 7.75, and I attribute that to the lack of clear communication regarding my drop-off schedule and the constant changes to my route that I only found out about while on the road. It felt like I was flying blind, which made an already long 17.5-hour drive even more taxing. Plus, the previous load was poorly secured, which added unnecessary anxiety during transit.

While I managed to deliver on time after spending a grueling 22.22 hours on the road, the lack of proper communication from the Operations department really put a damper on things. I faced multiple delays due to unclear instructions and inconsistent updates on my route, which shot my stress level through the roof—seriously, it felt like an 11.9 out of 10! On top of that, the overall trouble score was a 2.23, and it’s clear that something needs to change in how Operations handles routing and communication.

I noticed some discrepancies with my pay for this trip; the calculations seem off and it’s frustrating to see my hard work not reflected correctly in my paycheck. I’ve been driving for seven years now, and this is not the first time I’ve had issues with pay.

Plus, there were some discrepancies with the load instructions that wasted a good chunk of my time. With a trouble score of 0.86, it’s clear there’s a need for better planning and support. I’m just trying to do my job and keep things running smoothly, but it feels like I’m fighting an uphill battle when I shouldn’t have to.|1|2024-11-09 08:28:21

First off, the lack of communication from the Operations department was a major headache; I had to make multiple calls just to get basic updates on my pickup and drop-off schedules.

I spent an unnecessary amount of time waiting for updates and clarifications that should've been provided upfront, and it bumped my stress level to nearly a 10. On top of that, the route was poorly planned, with no consideration for possible road closures or construction, which added to the chaos.

2117|88|1|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I encountered with the Finance department after completing Route 1, which took me nearly 14 hours. While I delivered on time and didn't have any major incidents during the trip, the reimbursement process has been a nightmare. I submitted my expenses promptly, but it feels like I’m chasing ghosts to get any updates; it’s been over a week with no response.

It felt like I was talking to a brick wall most of the time, and it added unnecessary stress to an already long trip, which I rated a solid 7.7 on the stress scale. Plus, there’s been a lack of support regarding our workload and scheduling—it's like they have no clue what we actually go through out here.

2154|90|14|1|1|I just wrapped up route 14, which took me a grueling 18.17 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses hasn’t been processed, and it's been over a week since I submitted the paperwork. It’s frustrating to be driving long hours and then have to chase down my own money! Plus, I've noticed discrepancies in my pay from the last few trips, and I can’t get anyone to respond to my queries. This kind of stuff adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job, and it feels like the Finance team is dropping the ball big time.|1|2024-08-14 07:25:11
2155|90|34|1|1|I'm really frustrated with the way things have been handled by HR after my recent trip on route 34, which took me nearly 17 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, and I feel like no one is taking this seriously. My stress level was through the roof at a 14 out of 10, and with an overall trouble score of over 8, it’s clear this is not just a minor issue. I expected better support from HR, especially when safety is involved. I need to know what steps are being taken to address this and ensure it doesn’t happen again.|1|2024-08-17 01:43:36
2156|90|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, and I’ve gotta say, the Operations department really needs to step it up. While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was off the charts—like an 11 out of 10, and that’s not cool. I ran into major issues with routing; the directions were all over the place, leading to unnecessary detours that dragged my total driving time to over 22 hours. Plus, the lack of communication about load changes and delivery windows left me scrambling and feeling really unsupported. I’ve been driving for 8 years, and this was one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve had. We need better coordination and clearer instructions to keep our sanity on the road!|1|2024-08-22 00:15:30
2157|90|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, which took me nearly 11.9 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my mileage reimbursement was a mess—completely off from what I actually drove, and I had to double-check my logs just to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind. On top of that, the per diem for meals was late and didn’t cover what I spent, which is frustrating when you’re on the road for that long. It’s like no one’s paying attention to the details, and it’s making my job way more stressful than it needs to be. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-08-24 04:39:08
2158|90|34|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 34. First off, the delivery was late, which is unacceptable given my experience and the fact that I was on the road for nearly 20 hours. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and added an incredible amount of stress—my stress level during the trip was off the charts at nearly 11! Overall, I’d rate this whole experience an 8 out of 10 in terms of trouble, and I really feel like the Ops team needs to step up their game to ensure drivers like me aren’t put in such dangerous and stressful situations. This isn’t just about being late; it’s about safety and respect for the people doing the job.|1|2025-02-16 07:30:21
2159|90|33|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 33, and I’ve gotta say, the whole experience was pretty frustrating. While I did manage to deliver on time after 18.68 hours on the road, the stress I dealt with was off the charts—definitely a solid 10 out of 10. First off, the communication from the Operations department was non-existent when I hit a snag with the load at the halfway point, which left me scrambling to figure things out on my own. On top of that, the route they assigned me had a few unexpected detours that weren’t updated in the system, wasting even more of my time and adding to my stress. It’s not the kind of support I expect after 8 years in this game, and honestly, it’s time for some changes to make our lives a bit easier out there.|1|2025-02-19 16:42:20
2160|90|34|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent experience after completing route 34, which took almost 23 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, I encountered several issues that were frustrating enough to affect my stress level, which I rated at around 7.8 out of 10. It seems like there’s a serious lack of communication and support from HR when it comes to addressing our concerns about scheduling and the long hours we're expected to put in without proper breaks or acknowledgment. I feel like we’re just numbers on a spreadsheet, and it's really disheartening when you’re out on the road working hard and no one seems to care about the toll it takes on us. This needs to change.|1|2025-02-23 11:20:25

On top of that, I had to deal with a seriously stressful situation when I was assaulted during the delivery. My stress level was through the roof, hitting an 11 out of 10, and the overall trouble I faced was an 8.16. It’s unacceptable to have these kinds of issues compounded by the lack of support from Finance when it comes to addressing delays and safety concerns. I feel like my hard work and well-being are being overlooked, and it’s high time for someone to take notice and step up.|1|2025-03-28 18:54:42

While I managed to deliver on time, the support from HR has been lacking, especially when it comes to addressing issues like inadequate rest breaks and the unrealistic expectations placed on drivers. My stress level during this trip was through the roof, sitting at a 9.6 out of 10, and it feels like HR isn't listening to our concerns about driver well-being. It’s disheartening to feel like our voices aren’t being heard, especially when we’re out here working hard and doing our best.|1|2025-03-29 14:04:15
2163|90|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, which took me nearly 23 hours to complete, and I need to voice my frustration with the HR department. While I managed to deliver on time and keep my stress level pretty manageable, there were some glaring issues that I can't overlook. For starters, communication about my schedule was non-existent, leaving me in the dark about some last-minute changes that could have affected my route. Additionally, I’ve noticed a lack of support when it comes to addressing our concerns—like the equipment maintenance issues I’ve raised several times that still haven’t been addressed. It's really disappointing to feel like our voices aren’t being heard, especially after putting in long hours on the road. I hope this gets sorted out soon because it’s affecting morale out here.|1|2025-04-01 04:18:40
2164|90|32|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns about the Operations department after completing route 32, which took an exhausting 16.4 hours and ended up being late. Not only was the delivery delayed, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out beyond belief, hitting a stress level of nearly 11 out of 10. The overall trouble I experienced on this route was at an all-time high, and I feel like the lack of support and communication from Operations contributed heavily to this situation.

2165|90|14|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I encountered with the Finance department after wrapping up route 14, which took me over 16.5 hours to complete, and yes, I delivered on time. However, the stress level was through the roof, sitting at a 9.4 out of 10, and a lot of that came from the lack of clarity and communication from Finance regarding my pay for this trip. I was expecting certain reimbursements and bonuses based on the company policy, but the figures I received were way off and frankly, confusing. I tried reaching out for clarification, but the responses were slow and unhelpful, which only added to my frustration. It feels like I'm just spinning my wheels here, and I really need this sorted out so I can focus on driving, not chasing down paychecks.|1|2025-05-07 11:49:25
2166|90|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, and while I managed to deliver on time after 15.86 hours on the road, I’ve got some serious beef with the Human Resources department. First off, I’ve been waiting way too long for a response regarding my recent pay discrepancy, which has been super frustrating and added unnecessary stress to my job (my stress level hit a 7.3 during this trip). Plus, I’ve noticed a lack of communication and support when it comes to addressing driver concerns; it feels like we’re just not being heard. We put in the hard work out here, but it seems like HR doesn’t realize how their delays and poor communication impact us on the road.|1|2025-05-08 06:29:51
2167|91|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I’m really frustrated with the Finance department. Not only did I not get my delivery on time, which is already a huge issue, but I also had to deal with an assault during the trip that left me shaken and my stress level through the roof—like a 9.4 out of 10! It’s hard to focus on the job when you’re dealing with all this extra crap. On top of that, the whole experience has me feeling like an 8.0 in trouble, and I’m not sure how much more of this I can take. I expect better support from the Finance team, especially when there are safety concerns involved.|1|2024-01-16 07:48:09
2168|91|6|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up Route 6, which took me a grueling 19.23 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. For starters, communication has been a nightmare; I’ve been trying to get clarity on my benefits and they keep leaving me in the dark. It’s also really disheartening that there’s been no acknowledgment of the extra hours we’re putting in—it's like our hard work doesn’t even register with them. My stress level was a solid 7.7 during this trip, and it’s mainly due to the lack of support and respect from HR. We deserve better communication and recognition for the long hours we put in on the road!|1|2024-01-17 04:03:46
2169|91|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I've got to say, it was a nightmare. Not only was I late on delivery, which is frustrating enough, but I also faced some serious issues from the Operations department that made things ten times worse. The stress was through the roof, hitting a solid 9.5 out of 10, and to top it off, I encountered an assault situation that left me shaken. With an overall trouble score of 8.0, it’s clear that something needs to change. The lack of proper support and communication from Operations during this trip is unacceptable and puts us drivers in dangerous positions. I really hope you take this seriously because we deserve better.|1|2024-02-18 17:02:44
2170|91|6|1|1|I just wrapped up route 6, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to raise a few concerns about the Operations department that can’t go overlooked. First off, the route planning seemed off; I hit some unexpected road closures that added unnecessary stress and extended my drive to over 12 hours. Plus, the communication from dispatch was seriously lacking, leaving me in the dark about these obstacles and making it tough to adjust on the fly. It felt like I was navigating blind out there, which raised my stress level to nearly an 8, even though I was able to keep my cool. I’ve got a solid 10 years behind the wheel, and this kind of disorganization is just unacceptable.

While I managed to make the delivery on time and everything went smoothly on the road, I’ve encountered a serious issue with the expense claims process.

Honestly, the overall trouble score for this route was an 8.04, and I feel like HR doesn't take these issues seriously enough.

First off, the communication from the Operations department was seriously lacking—I didn't get clear instructions on the load's specifics until I was already on the road, which added unnecessary stress to my drive, rated about 7.81/10 for me.

2194|92|30|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent route 30 delivery, which took a grueling 11.28 hours and ended up late. On top of that, I had to endure an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 11.17 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that after all the hard work and the risks we take on the road, the Finance team seems to overlook the serious issues we encounter, not to mention the unnecessary delays and complications that add to our already high trouble score of 8.09. This kind of negligence is not only frustrating but also puts our safety and well-being at risk.|1|2024-03-24 06:37:39
2195|92|31|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 31 and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I did make the delivery on time, the entire trip was marred by a lack of communication and support. I spent over 15 hours on the road with a stress level that peaked at nearly 9.5 out of 10, and it felt like I was left to figure things out on my own. There were changes to the route that were not communicated until I was already on the road, leading to unnecessary stress and confusion. I expect better coordination and support from Operations, especially when it comes to keeping drivers informed about such critical details. It’s frustrating to feel like I’m on my own when I’m out there, and this needs to be addressed.|1|2024-03-27 13:18:19

The delivery was late, and honestly, it felt like the Operations team dropped the ball on planning. To top it all off, I was assaulted during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a whopping 11 out of 10—thanks for that! The overall hassle of this journey scored an 8 out of 10 on my trouble meter, and it’s clear that the lack of support and proper communication from Operations is seriously affecting our safety and efficiency out here.

The delivery was late, which really threw off my schedule and made for a stressful trip—my stress level hit a 9.5 out of 10! It felt like I was constantly dealing with unexpected delays and lack of communication about the route, which dragged the trip out to nearly 12.5 hours.

This kind of oversight is unacceptable, and it’s really impacting our performance on the road.|1|2024-04-14 14:12:00
2198|92|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and while I got the delivery there on time, I have to say the experience was far from smooth. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. First off, the load was poorly balanced, which made for a stressful 10.3-hour drive—I’d rate my stress level at an 8 out of 10, and that’s no joke. I also had to deal with a last-minute change in the drop-off location that wasn’t communicated until I was already en route, which messed with my schedule and made the whole trip feel chaotic. I get that things can change, but a little heads-up goes a long way. Overall, I’m left feeling pretty frustrated with how this whole route was handled.|1|2024-04-18 17:13:39
2199|92|31|1|1|I’m really frustrated with my recent experience on route 31, which took a grueling 16.57 hours, and I didn’t even manage to deliver on time! To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which skyrocketed my stress level to a whopping 12.69 out of 10. I can’t wrap my head around why the Finance department hasn’t addressed these safety concerns adequately, especially since my overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.04 out of 10.

2200|92|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, which took me a grueling 16.3 hours, and I need to express my frustration with the Human Resources department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.4 out of 10, and it’s clear this is largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR. I’ve repeatedly raised concerns about scheduling and the unrealistic expectations placed on drivers, but nothing seems to change. It feels like our well-being is being overlooked, and honestly, it’s not just affecting my performance; it’s affecting my life outside of work too. We need better management and support from HR to help us do our jobs effectively without this constant pressure.|1|2024-04-23 11:29:36
2201|92|31|1|1|I wanted to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Finance department after completing route 31. First off, my delivery was late, which I know can happen, but the lack of communication from Finance regarding the extra costs I incurred really added to my stress—my stress level hit an 8.42 during the trip! I feel like there was no support when I needed clarity on the additional fees and how they would impact my paycheck. It’s frustrating to work so hard for a long 20.99 hours and then be left in the dark about important financial details that affect my earnings.

2202|92|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and while I managed to deliver on time, I really need to address some ongoing issues with the Operations department that are driving me nuts. First off, the load planning was a mess; I was given conflicting information about pickup times, which added unnecessary stress to my trip. Plus, the lack of communication about road conditions meant I had to deal with detours that weren’t in my original plan, making my drive longer than expected—23.55 hours is no joke! I get that things can get hectic, but it feels like the left hand doesn’t know what the right is doing over there, and it’s making our jobs way harder than they need to be. Can we please tighten this up?|1|2024-04-27 08:12:11
2203|92|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced, particularly with the Finance department. First off, my delivery was late, which is already frustrating, but to add insult to injury, I encountered an assault during the trip—totally unacceptable and incredibly stressful. My stress level hit a ridiculous 13.9 out of 10, and the overall trouble score for this experience was an 8.2. It’s clear that the Finance department's mishandling of paperwork and lack of support contributed to this chaos.

My stress level shot up to nearly 11 out of 10 due to a lack of proper routing information and constant changes to delivery instructions that came in last minute. It felt like nobody had their act together, and I was left scrambling to adjust my plans on the fly. The overall trouble score was low at 1.02, but that doesn't reflect the kind of chaos I dealt with on this trip. This kind of disorganization is unacceptable and needs to be addressed so drivers like me aren’t left in the lurch.|1|2024-04-28 02:59:37
2205|92|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, which took me nearly 18.8 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my mileage reimbursement was way off, and I’m still waiting on the bonus for this trip that I was promised ages ago. It’s frustrating because I put in a solid effort, and feeling undervalued really adds to the stress of the job—my stress level hit an 8.5 during the trip! I’ve been driving for six years now, and it’s hard to stay motivated when the financial side feels so disorganized. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-04-29 00:43:56

Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced several hiccups that could have been avoided with better planning and communication. For instance, I encountered unexpected road closures that were not communicated to me beforehand, which added unnecessary stress to my trip, scoring about a 7 out of 10 on my stress scale. I also had to deal with incorrect shipping instructions that wasted precious time and left me feeling pretty fed up. Overall, my trouble score was low at 1.1, but the combination of issues made this trip much more challenging than it should have been. We need to do better!|1|2024-04-30 14:15:25

The load was poorly organized, and I had to waste precious time sorting through the paperwork that was incomplete and confusing. Not only did this increase my stress level to a solid 7.4 out of 10, but it also made me feel like my experience and efficiency were undervalued.

I made the delivery on time, so I expected everything to go smoothly, but when I checked my pay for this trip, it was way off. I’ve been driving for six years, and this isn’t the first time I’ve had issues with my paychecks being inaccurate. It’s just adding unnecessary stress on top of the already high stress level from the trip, which was a solid 10.7 out of 10 for me. Can someone please sort this out?

2210|92|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I have to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to complete the delivery on time, the entire trip was riddled with frustration that significantly upped my stress level to an 8.6 out of 10. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit unexpected construction zones that weren't flagged in the system, which added unnecessary time and confusion. Plus, the lack of clear communication about fuel stops left me scrambling to find a station when I was running low. I can't stress enough how these oversights not only impact our schedules but also our peace of mind on the road. I hope you can address these issues so we can avoid this kind of hassle in the future.|1|2024-05-25 06:36:12

On top of that, there’s been a total lack of support with the new scheduling system—it's confusing and stressful, making my job harder than it needs to be. Sure, I delivered on time, but the stress level was through the roof at an 8 out of 10, and the overall trouble score was a solid 2; it shouldn't be this difficult to get help when I need it. I'm just asking for some clearer communication and a little more support from HR to make this job a bit less of a headache.|1|2024-05-26 02:21:19
2212|92|31|1|1|I just wrapped up route 31, and honestly, it was one of the most stressful trips I've ever done.

The stress level during this trip was off the charts at a 10, and while my overall trouble score was low, it doesn’t change the fact that HR needs to step up their game to support us drivers better.|1|2024-06-09 23:50:15
2214|92|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, which took me nearly 12 hours, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the HR department. First off, I’ve been trying to get my questions about benefits and time off addressed for weeks now, but every time I reach out, I get the runaround. It’s frustrating to feel like my concerns are falling on deaf ears, especially when I’ve been putting in the hours and hauling loads without a hitch. My stress level during this trip was pretty high at almost an 8, not because of the driving, but because I’m constantly stressing about whether I’ll ever get a straight answer from HR. I really think we need better communication and support from that department; it’s just not working right now.|1|2024-06-11 17:59:57

2216|92|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, which took me over 9.5 hours, and I’ve got to say, the experience was pretty frustrating. While I managed to deliver on time, the Operations department really dropped the ball on a few things. First off, the route directions were way off; I ended up taking a longer path because of outdated information, which added unnecessary stress to an already tense situation—my stress level shot up to a 10 out of 10! Plus, the lack of communication about rest stops was ridiculous; I had to scramble to find appropriate places to take breaks, which isn’t safe or efficient. Overall, the trouble score may seem low at 2.09, but that’s only because I’m used to dealing with these kinds of issues. It feels like we’re not being given the support we need to do our jobs properly, and it's really wearing me down.|1|2024-08-14 13:33:29

While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress level throughout the 15.7-hour trip was through the roof—I'd rate it a solid 9.7 out of 10.

First off, the route I was given was poorly planned, leading to unnecessary detours that wasted time and added stress—my stress level hit an 11 out of 10! On top of that, I faced multiple delays due to lack of communication about traffic and road conditions, which could’ve been easily avoided with better coordination from Ops. Honestly, the overall trouble score for this trip was lower than it should've been, and I believe the Operations team needs to step it up to ensure drivers like me aren't left dealing with avoidable headaches on the road.|1|2024-01-28 04:24:33
2235|93|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I've got to address some serious issues with the Operations department that can't be ignored. While I did manage to deliver on time, the stress level was off the charts at a solid 9 out of 10. The communication was a complete mess; I was left hanging for hours trying to get updates on my next load, which really affected my focus and overall efficiency. It felt like I was driving blind half the time, and it’s frustrating to know that with a little better coordination, the trip could have been a lot smoother. I’ve got six years behind the wheel, and this kind of disorganization just isn’t acceptable.|1|2024-01-28 18:25:31

While I managed to deliver on time, I’ve been facing constant delays with my expense reimbursements and the lack of communication is driving me nuts. I've submitted my receipts over a week ago, and I've yet to see any progress or even get a response. It’s frustrating because I rely on those reimbursements to cover my expenses, and the radio silence makes it feel like my work is going unappreciated. I’d really appreciate it if you could look into this and ensure that the Finance team steps up their game.|1|2024-02-03 18:17:39
2237|93|18|1|1|I just finished route 18, and I can't believe the chaos I had to deal with, especially from the Finance department. First off, my delivery was late, and I ended up on the road for over 15 hours, which is just ridiculous. On top of that, I faced an assault while trying to manage this stressful situation, which pushed my stress level through the roof—seriously, it was an 11.3 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from Finance made everything worse, and honestly, it feels like they don’t care about the safety and well-being of drivers like me.

It seems like there’s been a mix-up with my reimbursement for the fuel expenses; I submitted the receipts over a week ago, and I'm still waiting for that to be processed. On top of that, I noticed some discrepancies in my pay stub that don’t match what was discussed in our last meeting. This is really frustrating, especially considering the stress levels I had during the trip were already high at around 7.72 out of 10.

This trip took me an exhausting 29.37 hours, and let me tell you, it felt like I was pulling teeth the entire way. Not only was the delivery late, but the lack of communication and support from Ops made everything ten times more stressful—my stress level was sitting at a 7.4 out of 10 by the end of it.

While I delivered on time and didn’t face any serious issues during the trip, I encountered significant problems with the reimbursement process for my expenses. It’s been a headache trying to get the right paperwork sorted out, and I have yet to see the reimbursement for fuel and tolls, which I submitted weeks ago.

It feels like I’m navigating these challenges alone, and the overall trouble score of 1.93 suggests that the issues I faced are not just isolated incidents but part of a larger problem that needs addressing.

You’d think after seven years on the road, I wouldn’t have to chase down basic answers. It’s honestly adding unnecessary stress to an already demanding job.|1|2024-05-28 01:11:22
2276|95|11|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 11, which took an exhausting 14.85 hours and ended up being late for delivery. To make matters worse, I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and added to my already high stress level of 11.58 out of 10. I’ve been driving for seven years, and I've never encountered such a combination of issues. The overall trouble score for this trip was a staggering 8.06 out of 10, and it feels like the Finance team isn’t acknowledging the real impact that these kinds of incidents have on drivers like me.

2277|95|6|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 6, which took me a grueling 18.64 hours, and while I delivered on time, I have some major beef with the Finance department. It’s frustrating to see discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up after all the hard work and stress I put in—my stress level hit a 9.34/10 during that trip! I’m not asking for much, just a clear breakdown of the pay and expenses because right now, it feels like I’m not being compensated fairly for my time and effort. I’ve got a trouble score of 1.23/10, which shows I handled the trip pretty well, but these finance issues are really dragging me down and making this job feel less rewarding.|1|2024-06-07 18:30:54

Not only did I encounter navigational issues due to outdated route info, but I also faced a serious situation when I was assaulted at a rest stop. This trip had my stress level through the roof—I'd rate it a solid 10 out of 10—thanks to the lack of support and communication from the Operations team. Overall, this experience left me with an 8 out of 10 on the trouble scale, and I believe it's high time we address these concerns to ensure the safety and efficiency of our drivers.|1|2024-07-15 22:43:47
2279|95|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, and while the delivery was on time, I gotta say the experience was pretty frustrating thanks to some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the route they gave me was way longer than necessary, leading to a stress level of about 8.4 out of 10, which is ridiculous for a job that should be straightforward. Plus, the paperwork was a mess—there were discrepancies with the load information that made things super confusing at the drop-off. It felt like I was driving blind half the time, and that’s just not acceptable when you’re trying to keep everything on schedule. I’ve been driving for seven years, and I really expect better communication and planning from Operations to avoid this kind of hassle in the future.|1|2024-07-17 11:48:36

First off, I didn’t deliver on time, which is already frustrating enough, but to top it off, I faced a seriously scary situation where I was assaulted during the drive. My stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 9.95 out of 10, and I’d rate my overall trouble with this route an 8.02.

Despite delivering on time after a grueling 16.35-hour trip, I’ve noticed some discrepancies in my pay that don’t add up. It’s really frustrating to see my compensation not reflect the hard work and hours I put in, especially when the stress level during the trip was an 8 out of 10.

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the lack of proper communication about the route and the unexpected detours really ramped up my stress levels to around 7.4 out of 10. It felt like I was flying blind at times, and that’s not something you want when you’re on the road. I think we need to work on better planning and updates to avoid these unnecessary hiccups in the future. Thanks for hearing me out.|1|2024-07-29 22:27:59

While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was riddled with preventable stressors that really added up—my stress level hit an 8.67 out of 10. First off, the route planning was a mess; I had to deal with unexpected road closures and detours that weren’t communicated ahead of time, which added unnecessary time to my trip—14.92 hours in total. On top of that, the cargo was loaded incorrectly, making it hard to secure properly, which had me constantly worried about safety. The lack of clear communication and support from Operations made this trip way more challenging than it needed to be.

It’s been way too long since I submitted my expense reports, and I still haven’t seen a dime reimbursed for my fuel and tolls, which is just ridiculous. Not only is this messing with my budget, but it’s also adding unnecessary stress on top of an already exhausting trip—my stress level was off the charts at 10.39! Honestly, I shouldn’t have to chase down my hard-earned money after putting in all this time and effort. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-09-23 03:04:15
2287|95|27|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 27, which took me a whopping 19.77 hours, and while I managed to make my delivery on time, I have to say the whole experience was far from smooth. The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one—communication was lacking big time, and I was left in the dark about several last-minute changes that caused unnecessary stress, pushing my stress level to an 8.14 out of 10.

It seems like there’s zero acknowledgment for drivers like me who are out there busting our butts, and I feel totally overlooked when it comes to addressing our concerns.

2290|95|40|1|1|I just wrapped up route 40, and while I made the delivery on time, I gotta say, the whole experience was a bit of a mess thanks to the Operations department. First off, the load was poorly organized, which made loading and unloading a real pain and added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level was sitting at 7.2 out of 10!

2316|97|50|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 50, which took me almost 30 hours, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. While the delivery was on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof—about a 9.3 out of 10! The lack of support and communication from HR has been a consistent issue, especially when it comes to addressing our concerns about work hours and pay discrepancies; it feels like our voices are just falling on deaf ears. I’ve been driving for 9 years now, and I thought things would improve, but this ongoing neglect just adds to the stress of the job. It's seriously impacting morale out here, and I hope you can understand where I'm coming from.|1|2025-03-22 10:20:24
2317|97|50|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Finance department after wrapping up route 50, which took me nearly 26 hours. While I delivered on time and didn’t have any safety issues, I was really frustrated with how my reimbursement was handled. I submitted all my receipts on time, but it’s been over a week with no updates, and I’m still waiting for my expenses to be processed. This delay is impacting my finances, and it’s unacceptable considering the long hours we put in. I’d appreciate it if the Finance team could step up their game and communicate better about these reimbursements to avoid this kind of stress in the future.|1|2025-03-23 23:30:00
2318|97|50|1|1|I'm writing to express my deep frustration regarding my recent experience on route 50, which took an exhausting 26.2 hours when it should have been a smoother process. Not only was I late with the delivery, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and on edge—my stress level peaked at about 9/10. It's unacceptable that the Operations department didn't provide adequate support or communication throughout this ordeal, especially considering my overall trouble score was an alarming 8.1 out of 10. This lack of oversight and protection is seriously concerning, and it makes me wonder if the safety and well-being of drivers are valued at all.|1|2025-05-05 09:04:02
2319|97|50|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 50, which took me just over 23 hours, and while the delivery was on time and I didn’t face any major issues on the road, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. It seems like my reimbursement for fuel costs is still pending, and this has become a recurring problem. I submitted the expenses over a week ago, and I’m still waiting for a response. This delay is affecting my finances, and it's frustrating to feel like I'm chasing down my hard-earned money after a long trip. We need to get this sorted out ASAP because it’s putting unnecessary stress on drivers like me who are out there working hard.|1|2025-05-08 05:22:32
2320|98|38|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 38, and I've got to say, this trip was a nightmare. It took me over 22.6 hours, and not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also had to deal with some serious issues on the road, including an assault that left me feeling shaken. The stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 11 out of 10, and overall, I’d rate this whole experience as an 8 out of 10 on the trouble scale. I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball here; better planning and support would’ve made a world of difference. We need to talk about better safety measures and more realistic timelines to prevent this from happening again.|1|2024-02-18 14:19:36
2321|98|10|1|1|I need to file a serious complaint about the Finance department because my recent experience on route 10 was absolutely unacceptable. The trip took nearly 10 hours, and not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also had a distressing encounter where I was assaulted, which pushed my stress level through the roof at a solid 16 out of 10. To top it all off, the overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.8 out of 10, and it feels like the Finance department is not taking these issues seriously.

2322|99|24|1|1|I need to file a serious complaint about the Finance department because my recent trip on Route 24 was a complete nightmare and, honestly, I feel like they dropped the ball. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, which is frustrating enough, but to top it off, I was assaulted during the trip, leaving my stress levels sky-high at about a 9 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from Finance when I tried to report these issues was unacceptable; it felt like they didn’t care at all about the dangers we face on the road. With an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10, I can’t help but feel let down by the system. We need better support and accountability, or it’s just going to keep getting worse for drivers like me.|1|2024-01-06 17:11:08
2323|99|6|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 6, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to voice some frustrations with the Operations department. The trip clocked in at over 14 hours, which is a long haul, and I found myself battling a lack of clear communication regarding the delivery schedule and load details. There were also inconsistencies with the routing instructions that added unnecessary stress, and my stress level hit about a 7.5 during the drive, which is pretty high for me. I’ve been at this for 9 years, and it shouldn’t feel this chaotic. If we could get better support and clearer guidelines from the Ops team, it would make a huge difference for drivers like me.|1|2024-01-07 18:30:53
2324|99|38|1|1|I need to vent about my recent experience on route 38—it was a disaster. First off, I was supposed to deliver on time, but instead, it took me nearly 17 hours, which is just unacceptable. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out, my stress level hit a 9.6 out of 10. With an overall trouble score of 8.0, I can't believe the Operations department didn’t prepare us better for this route. I feel like the lack of proper planning and support put me in a dangerous situation, and I really need someone to take a look at how things are being handled.|1|2024-02-23 19:32:36
2325|99|34|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 34, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say, the experience was far from smooth. The Operations department really dropped the ball on communication; I had to deal with last-minute changes to my delivery instructions that left me scrambling and added unnecessary stress to an already long trip that took nearly 19 hours. Plus, the lack of proper routing info made me second-guess my navigation, which is frustrating when you’ve got a tight schedule. I’ve been driving for nine years, and this kind of thing shouldn’t be happening—it's like nobody’s paying attention to the details that actually matter. It's not just about getting the load there; it’s about making sure we can do our jobs without the extra headaches.|1|2024-02-25 01:32:18
2326|99|12|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent route 12 trip, which took an exhausting 11.8 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I face ridiculous delays, but I also had to deal with an assault during the trip, which only cranked my stress level up to a staggering 9.6 out of 10. The overall trouble I faced was an 8.1, and it feels like the Finance team is completely disconnected from the realities of what we deal with out on the road. I really think they need to step up their game and understand how their decisions impact us drivers.|1|2024-03-30 05:22:59

Not only was the delivery late, but I also encountered an assault during the trip that left me feeling shaken and stressed—my stress level was through the roof at 15 out of 10! Despite my nine years of experience, this trip was a nightmare, and on top of that, the financial compensation for this ordeal doesn't seem to reflect the trouble I faced, which I rated an 8.8 out of 10. It's disappointing to feel unsupported in such a challenging situation, and I really hope the Finance team addresses these issues moving forward.|1|2024-03-31 15:58:24
2328|99|24|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 24, and I need to vent about some ongoing issues with the Human Resources department that are really getting under my skin. Despite the fact that I completed the delivery on time and managed to keep my stress level relatively low, I’ve been facing constant delays in getting my reimbursement for expenses incurred during this trip. It’s been over a month since I submitted the necessary paperwork, and I’ve had zero updates, which is ridiculous for someone who’s been driving for 9 years. It’s frustrating to feel like my hard work isn’t being acknowledged, and this lack of communication is seriously impacting my morale. I really hope someone can step up and address these issues soon.|1|2024-04-03 09:06:47

While I did make the delivery on time, the stress I faced was through the roof, sitting at a solid 9.09 out of 10. I had to deal with terrible communication throughout the trip—there were times I was left hanging, unsure about route changes and rest stop approvals, which only added to my anxiety. On top of that, the load was poorly balanced, making handling the trailer a real nightmare. I expect better coordination and support from the Operations team; it shouldn't feel like I'm out here solo when I'm trying to keep everything on track!|1|2024-04-05 11:39:18

While I managed to deliver on time and didn’t face any assaults, the constant lack of support and communication from HR has been incredibly frustrating. There seems to be a disconnect when it comes to addressing our concerns, and it feels like our needs are falling on deaf ears. With a stress level hovering around an 8.5 during the trip, it’s evident that the pressure is building, and I believe HR should step up to provide better resources and support for drivers like us who are out here working hard.|1|2024-04-24 20:26:19

It’s unacceptable that I’ve had to deal with not only the physical demands of the job but also the lack of support and communication from Finance regarding reimbursements for the extra expenses I incurred. My overall trouble score for this trip is an 8.1, and honestly, I feel like the Finance team needs to step up and address these issues, or I’m going to start questioning my future here.|1|2024-06-21 15:53:17
2333|99|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, and while I made the delivery on time, I really need to address some serious issues with the Operations department. First off, the communication was a mess—there were multiple times when I wasn't given clear instructions about my stops, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip that clocked in at nearly 20 hours. The lack of support when I encountered delays due to road construction was frustrating, and it felt like I was flying solo without any backup or updates from dispatch. My stress level hit an 8 out of 10 during the drive, mostly because I was left in the dark about what to expect on the route. This kind of disorganization isn't acceptable, especially for drivers who are out here grinding day in and day out.|1|2024-06-25 03:08:57
2334|99|34|1|1|I just finished route 34, and honestly, I’m pretty frustrated with how things went down, especially with the Finance department. First off, I was way late on my delivery, which is unacceptable for the reputation we’re trying to maintain. On top of that, I had to deal with some harassment along the way, which really spiked my stress level to a solid 9.3 out of 10. I get that we all have our issues, but I had to put up with an overall trouble score of 8.0 just because of some mishandling on your end. It’s disappointing to see how the financial side isn’t supporting the drivers like they should, especially when we’re out here risking our safety and sanity. Can we please get some clarity and better support moving forward?|1|2024-08-21 05:25:26
2335|99|34|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 34, which took me just over 21 hours to finish. While I managed to deliver on time and had no major issues during the trip—my stress level was somewhat manageable at around 7.8 out of 10—I can't ignore the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my questions about benefits and time-off policies. I’ve reached out multiple times but received vague responses or, worse, no responses at all. It feels like they don’t value our needs as drivers, and it’s really frustrating when we’re out on the road putting in the hours. We need better support from HR to make our jobs a bit easier, especially when we’re already dealing with the stresses of our routes.|1|2024-08-23 11:20:28
2336|99|38|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns about the Operations department following my recent completion of Route 38.

To add to the stress, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 9.8 out of 10. This made the whole ordeal feel unsafe and chaotic, contributing to an overall trouble score of 8.1.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof—honestly, it felt like an 11.9 out of 10! I had multiple issues with my paperwork that caused unnecessary delays and confusion, and it seems like there’s a serious lack of communication from HR regarding the changes to our routes and pay structure. It’s discouraging to feel unsupported when we’re out on the road, and I really think HR needs to step up their game to help us do our jobs more effectively instead of adding to the stress.|1|2024-10-12 22:13:13

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof—almost a 9 out of 10—mainly due to poor communication from the Operations department. There were multiple times I was left in the dark about changes to my route and loading times, which added unnecessary pressure and made it hard to plan my rest breaks effectively.

While I was able to make the delivery on time, the stress level I experienced throughout the trip was significantly impacted by the absence of timely updates and clarification on new policies that were rolled out without proper training.

Not only was my delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which is completely unacceptable and made things ten times worse. I don't understand how the Operations department can let these situations happen; the lack of proper communication and support was glaringly obvious, and my overall trouble score for this route was an 8.06 out of 10.

The lack of proper communication about rest stops made it nearly impossible to manage my breaks effectively, which is just unacceptable for a long haul like this. I also ran into issues with the loading process; there were delays that could have been avoided if the schedules were better coordinated.

The route was poorly planned, leading to unnecessary detours that added stress and wasted time, pushing my stress level up to an 8.2 out of 10. Plus, there were several miscommunications about pickup times that left me waiting longer than expected at the loading dock. With my experience in this industry, I know we can do better.

Everything went smoothly on my end—delivered on time, no major issues, and my stress level was through the roof at a 9.6, but that's not the point. The real kicker is the reimbursement for my expenses; it's been over a week since I submitted the receipts, and I still haven't seen a dime.

Despite successfully completing route 25 in just over 8 hours and delivering on time, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and unsupported, with a stress level hitting nearly 10.5 out of 10 during the trip. The lack of communication and assistance from HR has made it really tough to manage the daily challenges of the job.

2354|100|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, and I need to vent about some major issues I faced thanks to the Operations department. First off, while the delivery was on time, the planning for this route was a nightmare. The load was poorly balanced, which made driving a real hassle, and I spent way too much time looking for available parking spots that weren't just full of other trucks but also had limited access to restrooms or food. On top of that, I felt like I was constantly under pressure with unrealistic expectations for stops and rest breaks, which jacked my stress level up to a 9.4 out of 10. This kind of mismanagement is unacceptable and needs serious attention—it's making my job way harder than it should be!|1|2024-02-09 15:07:18

While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip took nearly 14 hours and honestly, a lot of that could've been avoided. The route planning was a mess; I hit multiple road closures that were not communicated to me beforehand, which added unnecessary stress to my drive, and I was left scrambling to find detours. Plus, I felt like there was a lack of support when I tried to reach out for help during those moments. My stress level was at a solid 7 out of 10, and while I kept it together, it shouldn't have to be that way.

I had submitted a request for additional resources and clarification on certain operational procedures before the trip, but I received no response. It’s disheartening to feel like my inquiries are falling on deaf ears, especially when I’m trying to do my job efficiently. The stress level during this trip was a solid 7 out of 10, and it would have been a lot lower if I felt like I had the backing of HR when I needed it.

2357|100|36|1|1|I’m really frustrated with the Finance department after completing route 36, which took me over 13 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with that stress, but I also faced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level to a solid 12 out of 10. The overall trouble score for this whole experience was an unacceptable 8.2, and I feel like the Finance team is dropping the ball when it comes to handling payments and support for drivers facing these insane challenges. It’s hard to focus on the road when I’m constantly worried about whether I’m going to get compensated fairly for the ridiculous situations we encounter out here.|1|2024-06-01 09:59:23
2358|100|9|1|1|I just wrapped up route 9, and honestly, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The trip took me over 14.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, the stress was off the charts—like a solid 10.5 out of 10. I faced delays due to poor communication regarding load availability and last-minute changes that messed with my schedule. It feels like the support we need out on the road just isn’t there, leaving us drivers in a tough spot. I get that things can change, but better planning and communication would go a long way in making our lives easier and keeping stress levels down.|1|2024-06-03 10:07:48
2359|100|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I gotta say, I’m really frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I felt during the trip was through the roof—almost a 10 out of 10! The route was poorly planned; I hit some crazy traffic that wasn’t accounted for, and the GPS directions sent me through a construction zone that added unnecessary time and hassle. Plus, the communication from Ops was pretty much non-existent when I needed clarity on a few things, which only made the whole experience worse. I’ve been driving for three years now, and this kind of disorganization is just unacceptable. I really hope you guys can sort this out moving forward.|1|2024-06-04 23:41:11
2360|100|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I need to vent about some serious issues I ran into with the Operations department. Although I delivered on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was through the roof—I'm talking a solid 9.4 out of 10. The lack of clear communication about route changes and the last-minute adjustments really threw me for a loop, making it hard to focus and drive safely. Plus, the load I was given was improperly secured, which added unnecessary anxiety to an already stressful situation. While my overall trouble score was a decent 2.5, the way things are managed in Operations needs a serious overhaul to prevent this kind of stress in the future.|1|2024-06-05 12:48:21
2361|100|36|1|1|I need to bring to your attention the absolutely unacceptable experience I had while completing route 36. First off, I was late with the delivery, which is not how I operate, but the Finance department's incompetence in handling my reimbursements made the entire trip unbearable. On top of that, I faced an assault that left me shaken, and to say my stress level was through the roof is an understatement—sitting at a solid 10.64 out of 10. With an overall trouble score of 8.02, I really feel like the lack of support from the Finance team contributed to this nightmare. I'm really frustrated and disappointed that I had to deal with these issues while trying to do my job safely and efficiently. It’s high time for some serious changes in how things are handled there!|1|2024-06-16 21:49:19
2362|100|2|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent route 2 delivery, which I completed in 8.04 hours — on time, by the way. Despite the smooth trip with a stress level hovering around 8.89, I've encountered ongoing issues with my pay that are really starting to get under my skin. There seems to be a consistent delay in processing my mileage reimbursements, and I've yet to receive the correct payment for my last few trips. It's not just about the money; it’s the principle of being compensated fairly and promptly for the hard work we put in. This lack of communication and efficiency from Finance is making my job a lot harder than it has to be.|1|2024-06-22 19:41:43
2363|100|9|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up Route 9, and while I made the delivery on time, I need to bring up some serious issues I faced during the trip. First off, the lack of communication from the Operations department was frustrating; I had no idea about the road closures until I was already on the route, which added unnecessary stress and extended my driving time to nearly 15 hours. Furthermore, the GPS directions were outdated, sending me through a few sketchy areas that I know better to avoid. It felt like I was driving blind out there, and with a stress level of about 7.6 out of 10, that’s just not cool. I really think better planning and updated information on routes could help prevent this in the future. Thanks for listening!|1|2024-06-23 22:50:01
2364|100|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, which took me over 12 hours, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced with the Operations department. First off, the load was way heavier than what was communicated, making it tough to handle on the road and causing unnecessary stress—I’d rate my stress level during the trip at a solid 7.2 out of 10. Then there were the route directions; they were unclear and led me through some questionable areas that wasted time and added to my anxiety. I get that we delivered on time, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of making my job harder than it needs to be. Overall, I’d say my trouble score was about a 2.4 out of 10, but it still feels like I faced more headaches than necessary. Can we please get better communication and support for future trips?|1|2024-06-26 15:11:04
2365|100|11|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent Route 11 delivery, which took an exhausting 11.6 hours and was not delivered on time. To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the trip, which skyrocketed my stress level to an unbearable 11.5 out of 10. The communication from Operations was lacking, and it felt like I was left hanging without any support when I needed it the most. Overall, this trip was a nightmare, with a trouble score of 8.1, and I believe the Operations team needs to seriously reevaluate how they handle such situations to ensure drivers like myself aren't put in these dangerous and stressful positions again.|1|2024-07-01 19:46:55
2366|100|2|1|1|I just finished Route 2, and honestly, I have to bring up some serious concerns with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication regarding route changes was frustrating and made my trip unnecessarily stressful—my stress level hit a solid 9.5 out of 10! I had to deal with unexpected detours that weren't mentioned in advance, which wasted my time and nearly threw off my schedule. Additionally, I noticed that some of the equipment I was assigned was not up to par, which added to the headache. This kind of oversight is not just annoying; it affects our efficiency and sanity out on the road. I hope this gets addressed because it’s becoming a real problem.|1|2024-07-02 05:37:10
2367|100|2|1|1|I need to voice my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent route. While I managed to complete my delivery on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my schedule and pay discrepancies. It feels like I'm constantly left in the dark when it comes to updates or changes, which only adds to my stress levels—around a 7.4 out of 10 this time. I shouldn’t have to chase down answers about my hours and compensation, especially after putting in over 7.3 hours on the road. It’s really disappointing because it feels like I’m just another number to them, and I think it needs to change for the sake of morale and productivity.|1|2024-07-02 17:00:51
2368|100|49|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I faced during my last trip on route 49, which took a grueling 23.68 hours and ended up being late. On top of that, I experienced an assault that left me shaken and stressed to the max—my stress level was off the charts at 10/10. The Finance department has really dropped the ball here; not only did I not get the support I needed during this harrowing experience, but the lack of timely communication about my pay has added to my frustration. Honestly, it feels like my safety and well-being are not being prioritized, and I’m fed up. This whole situation has resulted in an overall trouble score of 8 out of 10 for me, and it's completely unacceptable.|1|2024-08-01 00:16:27
2369|100|25|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 25, which took me around 8.42 hours, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the lack of clear communication and support was a real headache. I had to deal with incorrect drop-off instructions that led to unnecessary detours, which cranked my stress level up to almost an 8. It seems like there’s a disconnect somewhere because the overall trouble score was way too high for such a simple route. We need better coordination on these deliveries to avoid this kind of hassle in the future. Thanks for listening.|1|2024-08-02 23:08:41
2370|100|41|1|1|I’m writing to formally lodge a complaint about the lack of support I received from HR during my recent route 41 trip, which took me over 5 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I was assaulted during the delivery, and I felt completely abandoned with no clear guidance or support from the HR team when I reached out for help. My stress level was through the roof, hitting a solid 10.5 out of 10, and I just can’t understand why HR didn’t step up to assist me or even check in after such a traumatic experience.

2371|100|9|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent delivery on Route 9, which took over 18 hours to complete. While I managed to get the delivery there on time, the stress I experienced was through the roof, rating a 9.5 out of 10, largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my schedules and the hours I’m expected to work. I’ve tried to reach out multiple times about the overwhelming hours and feeling undervalued, but it seems like my concerns are falling on deaf ears. It's disappointing and frankly exhausting when you feel like you're just a number and not a valued part of the team. I hope this gets addressed soon because it’s affecting my morale and performance.|1|2024-08-17 21:53:13
2372|100|36|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 36, which took me over 11 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication and support from HR has been incredibly disappointing. I’ve reached out several times regarding my pay discrepancies and haven’t received any clear answers. It’s really stressful when you’re out on the road, and you can’t get the help you need, especially when I'm already dealing with a stress level of about 7 out of 10 during my trips. The overall trouble score might not seem high, but it’s the constant uncertainty that’s wearing me down. I just need HR to step up and address these issues more effectively.|1|2024-08-19 04:56:08
2373|100|49|1|1|I need to address some serious issues I faced on route 49, which took me nearly 19 hours to complete. First off, I didn't make the delivery on time due to some unforeseen delays, but what really got to me was the assault I experienced during the trip — it was incredibly stressful and left me feeling unsafe. My stress level hit a solid 12 out of 10, and with an overall trouble score of 8.2, I feel like the Human Resources department needs to step up and offer better support for drivers facing such dangerous situations. It's unacceptable that we’re expected to handle this alone without proper protocols in place.|1|2024-09-16 10:40:20
2374|100|41|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 41, and I feel compelled to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. This trip was a nightmare; not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also faced an unprovoked assault that left me shaken and stressed beyond belief—my stress level hit a staggering 16.8 out of 10! To top it all off, the overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.8, which is just unacceptable. I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to ensure driver safety and timely deliveries, because this is not the kind of experience we should be dealing with on the road.|1|2024-09-18 03:38:46
2375|101|28|1|1|I need to voice my serious concerns about the Operations department following my recent Route 28 delivery, which took an exhausting 17.3 hours and, to be honest, was a complete nightmare.

The overall trouble I experienced throughout this ordeal was an 8.1, and it’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a dangerous situation on top of the usual challenges of the job.

2376|101|49|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 49, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. The whole trip felt like a battle against poor planning and communication. I spent over 25 hours on the road, and it was incredibly stressful—my stress level hit an 8.5 out of 10. There were multiple instances where I had to deal with unexpected detours due to road closures that weren’t communicated to me ahead of time, leading to wasted time and fuel. Plus, the lack of proper rest area information made it hard to find safe spots to take breaks. It would be great if the Ops team could step up their game and ensure drivers are better informed and supported on these routes to avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-01-25 22:36:28
2377|101|13|1|1|I wanted to bring up some issues I faced during my recent run on route 13, which took me just about 15.78 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, I encountered several frustrating roadblocks that I think could be easily fixed by the Operations department. For starters, the route guidance was outdated, leading me into a construction zone that wasn’t marked and caused unnecessary delays. Additionally, there were a couple of rest stops that were supposed to be accessible but ended up being closed when I got there, adding to my stress and making it harder to stick to my schedule. While my overall trouble score is low, these hiccups definitely contributed to a stress level of about 7/10 during the trip, and I believe better planning and communication could really help improve the experience for drivers like me in the future.|1|2024-01-27 07:57:09
2378|101|9|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing route 9, which took an exhausting 15.9 hours—way longer than it should have, and definitely not on time. To top it all off, I was assaulted during the trip, which is completely unacceptable and made my stress level skyrocket to a ridiculous 12/10. The lack of support from the Operations department in handling this situation and ensuring driver safety is appalling, and honestly, my overall trouble score for this entire ordeal is an 8/10. I expect better from a company that values its drivers; we deserve proper support and protection, not to be left in the dark like this.|1|2024-02-04 00:34:25
2379|101|36|1|1|I just wrapped up route 36, which took me a grueling 11.25 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. It seems like every time I turn in my expenses, there’s a mix-up or a delay in processing, and it’s seriously messing with my ability to manage my finances. I shouldn’t have to chase down my reimbursements like a lost puppy, especially after a trip that left my stress level at a solid 9.4 out of 10. This constant back-and-forth is not only frustrating but also adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job. We really need to get this sorted out so I can focus on driving, not dealing with financial headaches.|1|2024-02-06 06:25:47
2380|101|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious concerns about the way the Operations department handled things. The trip took nearly 19.5 hours, and the stress level was pretty high at around 7.7 out of 10, mostly due to lack of clear communication about stops and delays. There were several instances where I wasn’t given accurate info on load availability and route changes, which really threw me off. It left me feeling frustrated and made the whole experience more challenging than it needed to be. I think we need to improve the way we communicate essential trip details to avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-02-07 12:07:20
2381|101|9|1|1|I’m writing to voice my serious concerns regarding my recent experience on route 9, which turned into a nightmare.

The overall trouble I encountered during this trip scored an 8.08, and frankly, I’m fed up with the lack of support from the Operations department. Their failure to provide proper route planning and communication led to this mess, and it's unacceptable that I had to endure such a dangerous situation alone.

2382|101|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13, and I’ve got to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Finance department that are really grinding my gears. Despite delivering on time after a grueling 17.16-hour trip, I noticed discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up. I’ve been driving for 9 years, and I’ve never had to deal with this level of confusion over my compensation. It’s frustrating when you're out there busting your butt on the road, and then you come back to find your earnings don’t reflect the hard work you put in. I’m not trying to make waves, but this is getting ridiculous and needs to be sorted out ASAP.|1|2024-03-20 10:18:51

First off, while I did manage to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof at an 8.4 out of 10, mainly due to the lack of clear communication regarding my stops and the tight scheduling that felt more rushed than necessary.

It's frustrating because I know things could run a lot smoother if we had better support and more realistic timelines. This isn't just about me; it impacts everyone on the road, and I think we need to seriously address these issues to make our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-04-28 18:02:30

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was pretty high, sitting at about an 8.2 out of 10. My biggest issue is the lack of communication and support from HR regarding our schedules and workload. I feel like we’re constantly left in the dark about route changes and expectations, making it tough to plan and manage our time effectively. It’s disheartening to see that despite our hard work, there’s little acknowledgment or assistance from HR to help alleviate some of the stress we face on the road.|1|2024-08-07 14:50:33

First off, the delivery was late, which is not only disappointing but also affects my overall performance and pay. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a staggering 14 out of 10—who can work under those conditions?

2389|101|40|1|1|I just wrapped up route 40, and while I got the delivery done on time, I have to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. The load was poorly organized at the warehouse, causing me to waste precious time trying to sort through the mess before I even hit the road. Plus, the GPS directions were way off, leading me to take longer detours that added unnecessary stress to an already tough trip—my stress level hit a solid 7.9 out of 10 because of it.

Everything went smoothly on the road, and I delivered on time, but I've been waiting way too long for my reimbursement for the expenses I incurred on this trip. I submitted my receipts over a week ago, and it's ridiculous not to have any updates. The stress level was already high, and not knowing when I'll get paid is only adding to it. Can we please get some clarity on this? It's becoming a real headache, and I don't want to keep following up just to get what I'm owed.|1|2024-08-20 00:22:30
2392|101|39|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 39, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, the whole experience was a lot more stressful than it should have been.

Not only did I face the usual stress of driving, but I was also assaulted during the trip, which ramped my stress level to an unbearable 12.55 out of 10.

The route planning was all over the place, leading to unnecessary detours and delays that could’ve been avoided with better communication and more realistic scheduling.

On top of that, the communication from finance has been lacking; I’ve sent multiple emails regarding the status of my payments, and all I get are generic replies that don’t address my concerns. This whole situation is adding unnecessary stress to my job, which is already challenging enough, so I really hope you can sort this out quickly.|1|2024-03-28 18:43:40
2398|102|10|1|1|I’m really fed up with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 10. Not only did I take an exhausting 11.42 hours to complete the delivery, which was late, but on top of that, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out of my mind—my stress level was off the charts at a 10.43! To make matters worse, the lack of support and communication from Finance about handling incidents like these is unacceptable. It’s frustrating to feel like I’m out here risking my safety for the company and not getting the backup I need. My overall trouble score for this trip is an 8.04, and I can’t keep putting up with this kind of nonsense.|1|2024-04-19 12:30:26
2399|102|7|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing my recent route 7, which took me about 12.5 hours. While I was able to deliver on time and had no safety issues or assaults during the trip, my stress level was through the roof due to the constant miscommunication about my pay. I’ve had to chase down missing reimbursements and clarify expenses multiple times, which has been an unnecessary hassle. It's really frustrating that I have to spend so much energy dealing with finance-related issues instead of focusing on driving and delivering goods. I just want to get paid accurately and on time without all this back and forth!|1|2024-04-20 14:01:40
2400|102|14|1|1|I just wrapped up route 14, which took me 21.21 hours, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got some serious issues with the HR department that need addressing. First off, communication has been a nightmare; I’ve reached out multiple times about my benefits and haven’t received any clear answers. It feels like I’m just being brushed off, and it’s adding unnecessary stress to my job, which was already at a 7 on my stress scale. Plus, I noticed discrepancies in my pay that I can't seem to get sorted out no matter how many times I call or email. This kind of lack of support isn't what I expect after seven years on the road, and it’s really frustrating to feel like I’m not being heard or valued.|1|2024-04-21 15:20:23
2401|102|10|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent trip on route 10, which took over 9 hours and was unfortunately not delivered on time. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 10.7 out of 10. I feel completely unsupported, as there seems to be a lack of communication and resources available for drivers facing such serious issues. The overall trouble score for this experience was an 8.1 out of 10, and I believe HR needs to step up their game to ensure we have the support and safety we deserve on the road.|1|2024-06-17 11:21:09
2402|102|7|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 7, and I need to vent about some serious issues I've faced with the Finance department. First off, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip; despite delivering on time after a grueling 11.5-hour haul, my compensation doesn’t reflect the effort I put in. It’s frustrating because I pride myself on being punctual and reliable, and to feel undervalued like this is just disheartening. Plus, I had to chase down my mileage reimbursements, which took way too long to process. It’s not cool when I’m out here busting my tail on the road, and it feels like the Finance team isn’t supporting us drivers properly. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-06-22 02:05:09
2403|102|10|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department following my recent Route 10 delivery, which took an exhausting 10.2 hours. Not only was I late on the delivery, but I also faced an alarming situation where another driver assaulted me on the road, which left me shaken and added an incredible amount of stress to an already tough day—I’d rate my stress level at about a 9.9 out of 10. The overall trouble I experienced during this trip was around an 8.0, and I can’t help but feel that better support and communication from Operations could have helped prevent this situation and ensured a smoother trip.|1|2024-09-17 05:53:03
2404|102|7|1|1|I just wrapped up route 7, which took about 9.6 hours, and while the delivery was on time and I didn’t face any serious issues on the road, I have to bring up some frustrating problems I encountered with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for the fuel expenses still hasn’t been processed, and it’s been over a week since I submitted the paperwork. It’s stressful dealing with that kind of delay, especially when I’m trying to keep my finances in check. Additionally, I noticed some discrepancies in the mileage reimbursement that don’t align with what I actually drove. I’m not one to complain often, but this is really starting to impact my bottom line, and I hope someone can look into it ASAP.|1|2024-09-17 18:21:24
2405|102|10|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent experience on route 10. Not only was the delivery late, taking over 11 hours, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me feeling unsafe and stressed out of my mind—my stress level hit a whopping 9.6 out of 10. To add insult to injury, I feel like HR has dropped the ball on supporting drivers in these situations; there’s been zero follow-up or communication about how to handle such incidents or prevent them in the future. Honestly, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.0, and I can't help but feel left in the lurch with no proper guidance or assistance from the department that’s supposed to have our backs.|1|2024-10-21 15:18:31
2406|102|14|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced with the Finance department during my last trip on route 14, which took nearly 15 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, I was hit with unexpected deductions from my pay that weren't explained or justified. It’s frustrating to see my hard work being undermined by confusing paperwork and lack of communication. I have tried reaching out for clarification, but the responses have been slow and vague, leaving me feeling undervalued and stressed out. This isn't the first time I've encountered problems like this, and it’s really starting to wear me down. I hope we can get this sorted out quickly because I can't keep doing my best on the road if I have to constantly worry about my paycheck.|1|2024-10-23 20:56:36
2407|102|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, and honestly, I need to voice my frustrations about the Operations department. First off, my delivery was late, and it took nearly 13 hours to complete, which is way longer than it should have been. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip—something that should never happen to any driver. The stress level was through the roof, sitting at a solid 9.5 out of 10, and with an overall trouble score of 8.0, it’s clear this route was a nightmare. I feel like the lack of support and communication from Operations really dropped the ball on this one, and it needs to be addressed before it happens again.|1|2024-11-15 00:20:49
2408|102|7|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 7, which took me a solid 13.3 hours, and was delivered on time. While the trip itself was manageable with a stress level of around 7.8, I ran into some serious issues with my pay and reimbursements that really put a damper on my experience. It seems like there’s been a mix-up with the mileage calculations and my fuel reimbursements haven't been processed yet, which is really unacceptable after putting in all that time on the road. It’s hard enough dealing with the long hours without having to chase down my hard-earned money. I’d appreciate a prompt resolution to this, as it’s impacting my ability to focus on my job.|1|2024-11-15 23:48:05
2409|103|10|1|1|I need to voice my frustration about the recent route 10 trip, which took me over 10 hours to complete, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. Not only was the delivery late—thanks to a lack of proper route planning from the Operations department—but I also faced an unexpected assault that left me shaken and stressed to the max, hitting a stress level of nearly 10 out of 10. The overall trouble I encountered was an 8 out of 10, and it’s unacceptable that I had to deal with these issues alone when it feels like there’s no support from Operations. I hope something changes because this isn’t just about me; it affects all of us out here on the road.|1|2024-02-10 15:23:50
2410|103|17|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 17, and while I’m glad the delivery was on time, I have to bring up a few serious issues I ran into that I think the Operations department needs to address. First off, the routing was off; I hit a couple of unexpected detours that added unnecessary stress and extended my driving time, which was already a hefty 9.43 hours. The communication from dispatch was also lacking—I had to figure out a couple of things on my own that should’ve been clarified before I hit the road. This kind of disorganization is frustrating and doesn’t help when my stress level is already sitting at an 8.25/10. I really think the Operations team needs to step up their game to ensure drivers have the support and information we need to do our jobs effectively.|1|2024-02-11 02:38:25
2411|103|16|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding the recent issues I faced on route 16. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication and support was frustrating. I encountered unexpected delays at the loading dock that weren't communicated to me ahead of time, which stretched my trip to nearly 15 hours, causing unnecessary stress. The route details were also unclear, leading to some confusion on my end. I believe better coordination and clearer instructions could have made this trip far smoother and less stressful. I'm hoping we can address these issues to improve the experience for drivers like myself in the future.|1|2024-02-13 06:20:39
2412|103|26|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration regarding the Operations department after completing route 26, which took a grueling 12.97 hours. Not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also faced a serious issue with an assault during the trip that left me shaken and added an unbearable level of stress—my stress level peaked at 9.68 out of 10! This is unacceptable, and I can’t help but feel that the lack of support and communication from Operations contributed to this whole mess. The overall trouble score of 8.06 speaks volumes about how poorly this route was managed, and I really hope you take this feedback seriously to prevent it from happening again.|1|2024-03-11 12:09:33
2413|103|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, which took me nearly 12 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I've got some serious concerns with the Human Resources department that need addressing. First off, I tried to reach out regarding some discrepancies in my pay for this trip, and it took ages to get a response, which is really frustrating when I’m out on the road dealing with stress levels that are already pushing 8 out of 10. Moreover, I’ve noticed a lack of communication about important policy updates, which leaves us drivers in the dark and can lead to unnecessary confusion. It feels like HR is really dropping the ball on supporting us, and that’s not what we need when we’re working hard to keep things running smoothly out there.|1|2024-03-14 10:56:17
2414|103|17|1|1|I just finished route 17, and I can't believe how rough it was this time around. First off, the delivery was late, which is just unacceptable when I'm doing my best to stick to the schedule. On top of that, I actually experienced some harassment from a couple of guys at one of the stops, which really ramped up my stress level to a crazy 12.4 out of 10. It’s not just about the delivery; it's about feeling safe on the job, and that totally failed here. With an overall trouble score of 8.0, I really think the Operations department needs to step up and address these issues. It's frustrating to feel like I'm out here risking my safety and missing deadlines without any support.|1|2024-03-16 23:44:31
2415|103|26|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent experience on route 26, which took an exhausting 16.43 hours to complete. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof, hitting a 9.92/10, primarily due to the lack of support and communication from HR. There were several issues with my load assignment and scheduling that weren’t addressed, leaving me feeling stranded and unsupported throughout the trip. It’s disappointing to see that after 11 years in this industry, I still have to deal with such disorganization and lack of responsiveness from HR. I really hope this gets sorted out because it’s making my job way harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-03-18 06:46:51
2416|103|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, which took me a grueling 13.6 hours, and I need to address some serious issues with the Finance department. First off, I was promised a timely payment for this delivery, but it’s been delayed longer than expected, and it's really affecting my finances. On top of that, the reimbursement for fuel expenses is a mess – I submitted my receipts over a week ago, and I still haven't seen a dime. This kind of disorganization is frustrating and stressful, especially when I'm out there on the road dealing with everything else. With my stress level hitting a 7.7 during the trip, I really shouldn't have to worry about getting paid on time. Please get this sorted out, as it's becoming a real headache.|1|2024-03-19 03:42:52
2417|103|26|1|1|I need to express my frustration regarding my recent experience on route 26, which took an exhausting 16 hours to complete, and not only was it late, but I also faced some serious issues along the way. To top it off, I encountered an assault that left me feeling unsafe and stressed out to the max, with my stress level hitting nearly 10 out of 10. The whole trip was a nightmare, and I'm really disappointed with how the Operations department handled things; it felt like there was no support when I needed it most, and the overall trouble I dealt with during this haul was way too high for a job that should be manageable. I just hope this gets addressed before someone else has to go through what I did.|1|2024-04-29 23:51:58
2418|103|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, which took me a grueling 16.6 hours, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department this time around. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the entire trip was riddled with issues—mainly a lack of clear communication about the route and some unexpected detours that really ramped up my stress level to nearly 9/10. I had to deal with confusing directions, and it felt like I was constantly second-guessing myself. Honestly, it’s not just about the hours on the road; it’s about the unnecessary stress they’re putting on us drivers. A little better planning and clearer communication could go a long way in making our jobs easier.|1|2024-05-02 17:40:43
2419|103|26|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after my recent trip on route 26, which took an exhausting 15.35 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 10.66 out of 10. I feel like HR has dropped the ball on providing adequate support and resources for drivers facing such serious issues on the road. My overall trouble score for this trip was 8.07, and it’s unacceptable that we’re left to deal with these kinds of dangerous situations alone. I really need to see some action taken here to ensure that drivers like me get the help we need when we face these challenges.|1|2024-06-02 06:17:15
2420|103|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, which took me about 11.46 hours, and I need to address some serious issues I've been having with the Finance department. While I managed to deliver on time, I’ve noticed some discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up, and it's really frustrating. For someone with 11 years of driving experience, dealing with these financial mix-ups is adding unnecessary stress to my job, which was already a solid 8.8 on the stress scale during this trip. It’s not just about the hours logged; it's about getting paid what I’m owed on time, and right now, I feel like I’m being shortchanged. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-06-03 10:50:27
2421|103|10|1|1|I'm really frustrated with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 10, which took over 10 hours and ended up being late. On top of that, I faced some serious stress during the drive—my stress levels reached a solid 10.8 out of 10. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault that added to the overall trouble score of 8.0 I’m dealing with. It's unacceptable that the Finance team hasn't been responsive or supportive regarding these issues, especially considering the high stakes and risks we face on the road. Communication has been lacking, and I feel like my concerns aren't being taken seriously. We need better support and accountability for the drivers out here, especially when we're encountering these kinds of issues.|1|2024-06-19 18:45:42
2422|103|10|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced during Route 10, which took me over 8.5 hours to complete, and I didn't even get the delivery there on time. The stress level was off the charts at nearly 16/10, and to make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip that left me shaken. It's ridiculous that the Operations department didn't provide me with the proper support or route planning to avoid such dangerous situations. My overall trouble score for this run was an abysmal 8.8/10, and I feel like the safety and well-being of drivers like me are being completely overlooked. This needs to be addressed ASAP before someone really gets hurt out there!|1|2024-06-26 10:51:20
2423|103|16|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 16, which took me just over 20 hours. While my delivery was on time and overall, I kept my stress levels somewhat manageable, the billing and reimbursement process has been a nightmare. I’ve noticed discrepancies in the fuel reimbursements and my per diem hasn’t been adjusted correctly despite my numerous submissions. It feels like I'm constantly having to chase down answers and it’s really taking a toll on my motivation. Can we please get this sorted out, as it’s becoming incredibly frustrating to deal with these issues after a long haul?|1|2024-06-27 21:45:28
2424|103|26|1|1|I need to express my serious frustration with the Operations department following my recent route 26 trip, which took me over 11 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the journey that left me shaken and on edge, contributing to a stress level that felt like a 17 out of 10. I really think the lack of proper communication and support from Ops played a huge role in this mess, and it's only added to my overall trouble score of 8.2. We can’t keep working like this; it’s unacceptable and puts us drivers at risk while also tarnishing our reputation for timely deliveries.|1|2024-07-01 21:49:01

2426|104|22|1|1|I just wrapped up route 22, which took me a grueling 17.5 hours, and I’ve got to say, the Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of proper route planning and inadequate communication regarding road closures and detours made the trip way more stressful than it needed to be—my stress level was an intense 9 out of 10! I also had to deal with a poorly loaded trailer that shifted during transit, adding to my anxiety and making me question the safety protocols in place. With five years of experience, I know how things should run, and this was just unacceptable. We need better coordination and support from Operations to ensure drivers aren't left navigating unnecessary hurdles.|1|2024-01-31 23:47:19
2427|104|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, and I’ve got to say, the experience was anything but pleasant. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, which is frustrating enough, but to top it off, I faced an assault during the trip that has left me shaken. My stress level was through the roof at 14.7 out of 10, and I’d rate the overall trouble with this route at an 8.2 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a dangerous situation while trying to do my job, and the Operations department really needs to step up their game to ensure drivers' safety and timely deliveries.

2428|104|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. Despite completing the trip on time—clocking in at almost 14.88 hours—the reimbursement for my expenses has been a nightmare to deal with. I submitted all my receipts and paperwork promptly, but it’s been over a week, and I still haven’t seen a single dime. The lack of communication from the finance team is adding unnecessary stress to my job, which is already tough enough; my stress level was through the roof at an 11.5 out of 10. I really hope you can sort this out quickly because it's making my job a lot harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-02-05 04:21:39
2429|104|22|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 22, and honestly, I’m pretty fed up with how the Operations department handled this trip. Not only was I way over my hours—17.23 to be exact—but I also delivered late, which is just unacceptable for the reputation we’re trying to keep. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the drive, which cranked my stress levels up to about a 16.5 out of 10. It’s hard to keep your head in the game when you're dealing with that kind of crap on the road. Overall, my trip was a nightmare with a trouble score of 8.1, and I think it’s time for some serious changes in how things are managed around here.|1|2024-02-07 05:01:34
2430|105|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty fed up with the Operations department.

The overall trouble score for this trip was an 8, and I can’t help but feel that the lack of proper support and communication from Operations contributed to this nightmare. It’s like we’re just out here on our own, dealing with all this chaos without any backup or reassurance from the company. This kind of treatment is not what I expect after 7 years on the road, and it’s high time someone addressed these serious issues.|1|2024-01-04 18:53:24
2431|105|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit multiple road closures that weren’t communicated beforehand, which added unnecessary stress and made the trip last over 13 hours. It’s frustrating to be on the road for that long, especially when I had to reroute without any support or updated info from Ops. Plus, the lack of communication about rest stops was ridiculous—there were stretches where I barely found a place to take a break, and that’s just not safe. This kind of oversight is unacceptable and needs to be addressed for the sake of us drivers and the overall efficiency of our operations.|1|2024-01-11 05:14:33
2432|105|42|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 42, and while I did manage to deliver on time, I’ve got to raise some concerns about the Operations department. The route planning was really off; I hit some unexpected detours that added unnecessary time to my trip, stretching it out to over 12 hours, which is pretty rough. Plus, I noticed the communication was lacking—there were no updates on traffic conditions or alternate routes, which left me feeling pretty stressed. I’d expect better coordination to help us avoid these hiccups. Overall, I think we can do better to support drivers on the road.|1|2024-01-11 18:40:18
2433|105|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and honestly, it was a nightmare. First off, I didn't deliver on time, which is a huge deal for us, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. During the trip, I faced a pretty serious assault situation that left me shaken and my stress level shot through the roof—I'd rate it a solid 10.5 out of 10. To top it all off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, which is unacceptable. I really think the Operations department needs to step up and address these safety concerns and the overall stress we’re under when we're out on the road.|1|2024-01-27 06:26:52
2434|105|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on my end—I delivered on time and didn’t have any issues on the road—but when I got back, I noticed that my paycheck doesn’t reflect the additional hours I put in. I clocked 7.44 hours this trip, but it seems like they’re shorting me on my pay. It's really stressful dealing with this kind of stuff when I’m just trying to do my job right; my stress level shot up to an 8.5 during the trip just thinking about getting this resolved. I hope they can sort this out quickly because it's not the first time I've had issues with my pay, and it's starting to become a real pain.|1|2024-01-28 08:01:59
2435|105|29|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 29, which took an exhausting 8.93 hours and was far from smooth. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an unsettling situation where I was assaulted while on the road, which escalated my stress level to a staggering 10.4 out of 10. This not only put my safety at risk but also highlighted a serious lack of support from Operations when it comes to driver welfare and timely communication. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, which is unacceptable for someone with my level of experience. We need better protocols and support systems in place to ensure that drivers can complete their routes safely and on time without facing such extreme challenges.|1|2024-04-19 01:26:14
2436|105|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, which took me a grueling 11.35 hours, and while I managed to make the delivery on time, I’ve got to say the whole experience was pretty frustrating. The Operations department really dropped the ball on a few things — first off, the directions given were off, which led to unnecessary detours and added stress to an already long drive. Plus, there was a lack of communication about the drop-off details, which made it harder to navigate once I got there. I’d rate my stress level during the trip an 8.7 out of 10, mostly because I felt like I was left to figure things out on my own. I hope you can address these issues because they really made an otherwise straightforward delivery way more complicated than it needed to be.|1|2024-04-19 22:18:43

On top of that, I faced an assault that left me shaken, and my stress level hit a crazy high of 12.5 out of 10. It feels like the Finance team doesn’t have a clue about the challenges we face out on the road—my overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.12! I expected better support and communication, especially when it comes to safety and timely payments. This situation has really made me question whether my hard work is truly appreciated.|1|2024-05-01 01:54:52
2438|105|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and while I managed to deliver on time, I've got some serious beef with the Operations department. The entire trip took almost 8.9 hours, but the stress level was off the charts—nearly a 10! I encountered multiple issues with the dispatch communication; it felt like I was left in the dark about crucial details, which made navigating some tight spots a nightmare. Plus, the loading times were way longer than promised, which really threw off my schedule and added unnecessary pressure. If this keeps happening, it’s going to drive me up the wall!|1|2024-05-03 23:43:36
2439|105|26|1|1|I want to bring up some serious issues I've been having with the Human Resources department that are really starting to grind my gears. Even though I just wrapped up route 26 and delivered on time after a grueling 12.9-hour drive, I can't shake off the feeling that HR has dropped the ball on a few things. First off, communication has been terrible; I’ve had to chase down updates on my benefits and paychecks like I’m hunting for a lost freight shipment. On top of that, there’s been a lack of support when it comes to addressing workload concerns, which has only added to my stress level (around 7.7 out of 10, by the way). I really think HR needs to step it up; we deserve better than this!|1|2024-05-10 02:48:39
2440|105|26|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns about my recent experience on route 26, which took a grueling 10.57 hours—definitely not what I signed up for. First off, the delivery was late, and that’s not just a minor inconvenience; it throws off my entire schedule and impacts my earnings. On top of that, I faced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level up to nearly a perfect 10—9.98, to be exact. The whole situation was incredibly unsettling, and I can’t help but feel let down by the Operations department for not ensuring safer conditions and better timing. Overall, my trouble score for this trip was an 8.05, and that’s just unacceptable in this line of work. I really hope this gets addressed, because I can’t keep doing this if it’s going to be like this every time.|1|2024-06-15 13:46:45
2441|105|42|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I faced on route 42 that have left me frustrated and quite frankly, worried about our safety and efficiency. First off, I didn't make the delivery on time, which is already a big deal, but the stress level throughout the trip was off the charts—like a 15.4 out of 10! To top it off, I experienced an assault during the haul, which is absolutely unacceptable and should never happen to any driver. The Finance department really needs to step up their game because the overall trouble I encountered was an 8.8 out of 10, and it feels like my safety and well-being are being overlooked. This isn't just about the money; it's about our lives out there on the road.|1|2024-06-18 17:56:07
2442|105|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and I need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip was a nightmare, with my stress level peaking at an insane 12.26 out of 10. The main issue was the lack of proper communication regarding road conditions and traffic updates; I encountered unexpected detours that could have been avoided if I had been given the right info beforehand. On top of that, the load was poorly balanced, making my drive feel more like a wrestling match with the trailer. I’ve been driving for 7 years now, and this kind of oversight is just unacceptable. It’s time for some serious improvements before someone gets hurt out there or we start losing valuable time and resources.|1|2024-06-19 18:45:06
2443|105|42|1|1|Hey team, I just got off Route 42, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to raise some serious concerns about the Operations department. The trip took over 9.6 hours, and honestly, my stress level was through the roof at a solid 9.9 out of 10. The route was poorly planned, with multiple detours that seemed unnecessary and added to my frustration. Not to mention, I had a hard time getting the necessary support when I hit a few snags along the way. It's tough to keep morale up when the planning and communication just don't seem to be there. I hope we can address these issues moving forward because this kind of experience is not what any of us signed up for.|1|2024-06-23 03:00:48
2444|105|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, which took me about 7.68 hours, and while the delivery was on time, I have to say I'm really frustrated with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses is still pending, and it's been over a week since I submitted the paperwork. On top of that, the mileage rates seem off; I double-checked my logs, and they don’t match what I was reimbursed for my last couple of trips. This kind of mix-up is really stressing me out — my stress level hit a solid 7.5 during the trip because I was worried about getting my hard-earned money back on time. Can someone please look into this? It’s really starting to feel like a hassle that I shouldn’t have to deal with.|1|2024-06-23 19:36:24
2445|105|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and honestly, I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. First off, I didn't make the delivery on time, which is already a headache, but what really pushed my stress level to a solid 10 was the assault I faced during the trip. It was completely uncalled for, and it made an already tough job feel unbearable. The overall trouble score for this journey was an 8.07, and I know it could have been avoided if there had been better support and communication from Ops. I feel like I've been left out here to fend for myself, and it's really affecting my work and mental state.|1|2024-07-26 06:07:59
2446|105|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and I need to vent about some serious issues with the Finance department. While I delivered on time and the trip itself was fairly smooth, my pay for this route was completely messed up. It took me 8.41 hours to complete, and I expected to see that reflected in my paycheck, but instead, I was shorted on hours and reimbursements for my expenses. This isn’t the first time I’ve had issues like this, and it’s frustrating to feel like my hard work isn’t being recognized. I get that things can slip through the cracks, but when it happens repeatedly, it really starts to wear on you. Can someone please get this sorted out?|1|2024-08-02 02:52:14
2447|105|26|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department following my recent trip on route 26, which took me 10.5 hours but ended up delayed and not on time. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a staggering 13 out of 10. This not only made the drive incredibly taxing but also left me feeling unsafe and unsupported. Overall, I’d rate the troubles I encountered an 8 out of 10, and I really think the Operations team needs to step it up in terms of planning and ensuring driver safety. This isn’t just about schedules; it’s about our well-being out there on the road.|1|2024-08-12 15:23:06

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced was off the charts—my stress level hit about 10.5 out of 10, and that’s just not acceptable for someone who's been in this game for 7 years. It feels like there’s no backup when it comes to addressing our concerns or providing the resources we need to handle our routes smoothly. I shouldn’t have to feel this overwhelmed on a job that should be manageable. I really think HR needs to step up and do a better job of supporting drivers like me.|1|2024-08-19 20:00:20

Everything went smoothly on the road, but I’ve been dealing with some serious issues when it comes to my pay. I noticed discrepancies in the mileage reimbursement and a delay in processing my expenses, which has made things really tight for me financially. It’s frustrating because I depend on this income, and it feels like I’m constantly having to chase down answers instead of focusing on my work. I’d appreciate it if someone could look into this and help sort it out ASAP, as it’s becoming a real headache.|1|2024-08-24 09:13:37
2450|105|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and I need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department.

My stress level during the trip was around 7.7 out of 10, which is a lot for me, especially since I’m used to handling tough situations. Overall, I scored my trip a 1.6 out of 10 in terms of trouble, but it still left me feeling pretty worn out. We need to step up our game to make these routes smoother and more efficient.|1|2024-08-25 11:01:00

First off, the delivery was late, and I really don’t appreciate how that affects my schedule and pay. On top of that, I faced an assault during the trip, which left me shaken and stressed out to the max—my stress level was through the roof at nearly a 10!

I expected better support from Operations, but it feels like they dropped the ball on this one.|1|2024-12-04 06:39:02
2452|105|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I have to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The route was overly complicated, and the directions provided were unclear, which wasted valuable time and added unnecessary stress—my stress level hit an 8.4 during the trip! Plus, there were several key stops that weren’t properly communicated, making it tough to stick to the schedule. I’ve been driving for 7 years, and this isn't the first time I’ve faced these kinds of issues, so I really think it’s time for some serious improvements in how routes are planned and communicated.|1|2024-12-05 01:36:40
2453|105|42|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration and concern after completing route 42, which turned into a nightmare. First off, the delivery was late, and it took me over 12.8 hours—a real strain, especially when you factor in the insane stress I felt throughout the trip, which I'd rate at a 12.99 out of 10. To make matters worse, I unfortunately experienced an assault during the route, which left me shaken and questioning the safety protocols in place.

2454|105|29|1|1|I'm writing to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department after my recent route 29 trip, which took me just under 7.8 hours and, thankfully, was delivered on time. While everything went smoothly on the road, I encountered a massive headache when it came to expense reimbursements. I submitted my receipts almost two weeks ago, and I still haven't seen a dime come through. The lack of communication and follow-up from the Finance team has left me stressed to the max, scoring a solid 10.3 on my stress meter. I expect timely reimbursements, especially after putting in the effort to keep our deliveries on schedule. This delay is unacceptable, and I really need this sorted out ASAP.|1|2024-12-17 05:15:09
2455|105|42|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 42. While I managed to complete the delivery on time, the whole experience was marred by a lack of proper communication and support. I spent almost 9 hours on the road, and the stress level was through the roof at an 8.5 out of 10, mainly due to unclear directions and missing paperwork that caused unnecessary delays at the drop-off point. It felt like I was doing a lot of the heavy lifting on my own, and it’s disappointing that the Operations team didn’t provide the necessary assistance to make this trip smoother. A little better coordination would go a long way in helping us drivers do our jobs effectively.|1|2024-12-21 03:01:12
2456|106|15|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 15, and I have to say, this trip was one of the toughest I've ever faced in my six years on the road. Not only was the delivery late, but I also experienced an assault during the journey that left me shaken and my stress level through the roof at an 11 out of 10. On top of that, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, which is unacceptable.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof, hovering around a 9.86 out of 10. I feel like HR isn't doing enough to address the mounting pressure we're under, especially when it comes to scheduling and rest breaks. It's like they don’t get how taxing these routes can be on our mental health. Communication from them has been spotty at best, which adds to the overall trouble we face on the road. This needs to change if they want to keep drivers feeling supported and motivated.|1|2024-03-14 02:20:52
2458|106|15|1|1|I'm writing to bring up some frustrations I faced during my recent trip on Route 15, which took a whopping 15.17 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, I experienced some pretty annoying issues with the Operations department that need addressing. For starters, the route directions were outdated, leading me into a couple of dead ends and adding unnecessary stress to an already long haul. Additionally, the lack of timely communication about road closures made it tough to stay on schedule, which is a real headache when you're trying to keep everything running smoothly. Overall, my stress level was around an 8 out of 10, and I believe these operational hiccups contributed significantly to that. Let's get these issues sorted out so we can make future runs smoother for everyone involved.|1|2024-03-17 01:17:30

First off, the delivery was late—14.73 hours on the road and still not on time, which is beyond frustrating. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and more stressed than I can handle, pushing my stress level to an 11.38 out of 10. This is unacceptable, and it’s clear that the Operations department needs to step up their game, especially when it comes to ensuring driver safety and timely deliveries.

2460|106|15|1|1|I just wrapped up route 15, and I’ve got to say, the experience was pretty frustrating, despite the delivery being on time. My trip clocked in at nearly 18 hours, which is way longer than it should’ve been, and it felt like I was dealing with constant delays due to poor communication from the Operations department. I was left hanging for updates multiple times, and it felt like I was just driving in the dark. My stress level hit almost a 10 out of 10, and while I didn’t experience any assaults or anything drastic, the lack of support and responsiveness from Ops really made this trip a nightmare. It's like no one is paying attention to how these delays affect us drivers on the road!|1|2024-06-17 14:27:31
2461|106|14|1|1|I just wrapped up route 14, which took me a grueling 16.62 hours, and while I’m glad the delivery was on time, I have to vent about the Finance department. There’s been a mix-up with my pay for this trip; I was expecting the usual compensation, but it seems like they shorted me a couple hundred bucks due to some clerical error. I've been driving for six years now, so I know how things should go, and honestly, the stress of having to chase this down is really wearing me out. I’ve got a high stress level as it is, and dealing with this on top of everything else is just unacceptable. Can someone please sort this out?|1|2024-06-18 13:10:26

First off, communication has been a nightmare; I reached out multiple times about some discrepancies in my pay and never got a clear answer. It’s incredibly stressful trying to navigate this job when I can’t even get basic support from HR. Plus, it feels like they don't really care about our well-being—there's been no follow-up on the mental health resources they promised us. I get that the job can be tough, and I’m managing, but a little more support from HR could go a long way in reducing the stress we face out on the road.|1|2024-06-23 04:19:03

While I delivered on time and didn’t face any assaults, the immense stress level of 10.39 out of 10 I experienced was largely due to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding my workload and scheduling. It felt like I was left in the dark about essential updates, and when I tried to reach out for assistance, my concerns were either brushed off or ignored. I’ve been on the road for six years, and this kind of experience is unacceptable; it’s affecting my mental well-being and overall job satisfaction. It’s high time HR steps up and addresses these issues seriously.|1|2024-10-08 01:47:45

First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit way too many construction zones that weren't mentioned in the pre-trip brief, and it added unnecessary stress to an already long haul, pushing my stress level to nearly an 8 out of 10. Plus, the lack of communication on the load details made it tough to manage my time effectively. I shouldn't have to deal with surprises on the road that could have been avoided with better planning.

The overall trouble I faced throughout this journey was a solid 8/10, and I can't help but feel like the Finance department is dropping the ball when it comes to supporting drivers like me in tough situations.

First off, there was a lack of communication regarding the load details; I was left in the dark about the specific weight and dimensions, which made it really stressful to navigate tight spaces. Also, the GPS directions provided were way off, leading me to a construction zone that I had to backtrack from, adding unnecessary time to my trip. With a stress level of 8.5 out of 10, it's clear that these issues need to be sorted out to make our jobs easier.

First off, the reimbursement for my fuel and toll expenses was a train wreck; it took ages to process, and I ended up covering costs out of pocket. To make matters worse, I got assaulted during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a ridiculous 12 out of 10, and I still wasn’t compensated for the time lost due to that incident. The trip ended up taking over 10 hours, way longer than it should’ve, and on top of everything, the delivery was late.

The routes you guys provided were poorly planned, causing me to navigate through heavy traffic and construction zones that were not indicated, pushing my stress level to a whopping 9.5 out of 10. On top of that, the communication was completely lacking; I reached out multiple times for updates on my delivery windows, but it felt like I was talking to a wall.

The communication throughout the trip was seriously lacking; I had no updates on delays at the drop-off point, and the routing was off, which added unnecessary stress to an already long haul—my stress level hit a solid 7.2 out of 10.

The trip took me just over 7 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time without any major issues, the payroll errors have been driving me up the wall. I noticed discrepancies in my pay that don't match the hours I worked on this trip, and it’s not the first time this has happened. It’s really stressing me out—my stress level was almost a 10 during the trip because of this lingering worry.

2477|107|35|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 35, which took about 8.7 hours, and while I delivered on time without any issues like assault or major troubles, I need to voice my frustrations with the Human Resources department. It’s been increasingly difficult to get timely responses for the benefits I’ve been trying to sort out, and the lack of communication is really wearing me down. I feel like after seven years of driving, I shouldn’t have to chase down answers or wait weeks for someone to get back to me about basic stuff. It’s just adding unnecessary stress to my job, which is already challenging enough. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-03-10 17:46:29
2478|107|42|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 42 that took an exhausting 9.22 hours, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare from start to finish. Not only did I miss the delivery deadline, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me rattled and my stress levels soaring to a ridiculous 12.77/10. To top it all off, the lack of support and communication from the Finance team regarding my expenses and compensation for this harrowing experience has been completely unacceptable. With an overall trouble score of 8.12/10, I really expected better from a company that claims to prioritize the well-being of its drivers.|1|2024-03-20 21:54:39
2479|107|20|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 20, which took me a grueling 15.6 hours, and I gotta say, I’m pretty fed up with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on the delivery side—got there on time and didn’t face any assaults or crazy issues. But the stress level was through the roof, sitting at nearly 10.7 out of 10, mostly because I can’t get any clarity on my pay for this trip. It's frustrating to deal with the lack of communication and delays in processing payments. I’ve got bills to pay and the uncertainty from Finance is just adding to the stress of the job. Can we please get some better accountability and responsiveness from that department?|1|2024-03-24 03:39:58
2480|107|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and while I got the delivery done on time, I've got to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the load was poorly balanced, which made for a stressful drive—my stress level was around an 8 out of 10. Plus, the directions provided were unclear, leading me to waste precious time trying to find the right drop-off point. I’ve been driving for 7 years, and I shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of disorganization. It’s frustrating, and it really impacts our efficiency on the road. We need better communication and support from Ops to avoid these headaches in the future!|1|2024-03-24 15:00:51
2481|107|1|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent route. It took me over 8 hours to complete the delivery, and not only was it late, but I also faced a distressing situation where I was assaulted during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a staggering 13 out of 10. The lack of support or communication from Finance while I was dealing with this chaos was appalling. With an overall trouble score of over 8, I expected better handling of my situation, especially considering I’ve been in this industry for 7 years. This is unacceptable, and I hope changes are made to ensure safety and support for drivers like me in the future.|1|2024-03-26 04:46:37
2482|107|20|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 20, which took me a grueling 16 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the drive was off the charts at 11/10, mainly due to the constant uncertainty about my compensation for this trip. It feels like every time I turn around, there’s some new issue with reimbursements or pay discrepancies that I've got to chase down. Honestly, it’s exhausting and adds unnecessary pressure on top of an already tough job. I expect better communication and accountability from Finance; it’s becoming a real hassle that’s affecting my ability to focus on driving safely.|1|2024-03-27 19:15:39
2483|107|35|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 35, which took an exhausting 11.61 hours and ended up being late. I encountered multiple issues that contributed to this delay, including a lack of clear directions and outdated information about road closures that weren’t communicated until I was already on the way. This not only ramped up my stress levels—about an 8 out of 10—but also left me feeling unsupported during the entire process. I’ve been driving for 7 years, and I expect better coordination and communication from the Operations team. It’s disappointing to see these avoidable problems cropping up, affecting my ability to deliver on time.|1|2024-03-30 16:55:50

To make matters worse, I faced an ugly situation where I was assaulted during the delivery—something no driver should ever have to deal with. The stress level throughout this trip shot up to an unbearable 12 out of 10, and my overall trouble score was an 8.1, which is just unacceptable. I feel like there’s a lack of support and communication from Operations when it comes to ensuring our safety and timely deliveries. This experience has left me feeling really disheartened and unsupported, and I hope something changes before it happens again.|1|2024-04-05 07:42:35
2485|107|35|1|1|I just wrapped up route 35, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced with the Finance department. While I managed to deliver on time after an exhausting 8.24-hour trip, it’s frustrating that my reimbursement for fuel expenses hasn’t been processed yet, despite me submitting the receipts over a week ago. It’s really adding to my stress, which was already through the roof at a 9.45 during the trip, and the lack of communication from Finance is just unacceptable. I keep getting the runaround, and it's making my job even harder than it needs to be. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-04-06 12:17:16

Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an unsettling situation where I was assaulted during the trip; that really ramped up my stress level to a staggering 15/10. To top it off, my overall trouble score for this journey hit an 8/10, which is unacceptable. I feel like the Finance team needs to get their act together because the delays in processing are only adding to the stress we drivers face on the road.|1|2024-04-08 21:51:52
2487|107|17|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 17, and I need to vent about some serious issues I encountered with the Finance department. First off, despite delivering on time after nearly 9.64 hours on the road, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip that don’t match up with what was agreed upon. It feels like I’m getting shortchanged for my hard work, and it’s frustrating because my stress level was already high at 12.1 out of 10 during the trip. The overall trouble score is low at 1.6, but this finance issue is really putting a damper on things. Can someone please look into this and sort it out?|1|2024-04-10 06:41:45
2488|107|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, and while I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was incredibly stressful—my stress level hit a 9.5 out of 10! The Operations department really dropped the ball this time. I encountered multiple issues with the route directions that were outdated, causing me to waste time trying to navigate around closed roads, and the load was poorly balanced, making the truck feel unstable. I also had to deal with some last-minute changes in pick-up times that weren’t communicated to me until I was already on the road. It’s frustrating to have to deal with all this when I’m just trying to do my job efficiently. I really hope these issues get sorted out because it’s making my job a lot harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-04-12 00:31:10
2489|107|12|1|1|I just wrapped up route 12, which took me about 12.24 hours, and I need to bring up some serious issues with the Finance department. While I delivered on time and didn’t face any assaults during the trip, my stress level was still pretty high, sitting at about a 7.5 out of 10, mainly because the reimbursement for my fuel expenses hasn’t been processed yet. I submitted everything on time, and it’s been over a week with no updates. It’s frustrating to be out here working hard and not get reimbursed for the costs I’m incurring. I really need this sorted out so I can focus on driving instead of stressing about my finances.|1|2024-04-15 11:30:59
2490|107|1|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about my recent route 1 trip, which took an exhausting 13.22 hours and was nowhere close to being on time. The stress level during this trip was through the roof, hitting a staggering 9.91 out of 10, mainly because I experienced an assault that left me shaken and feeling unsafe on the road. To top it off, I’d rate my overall trouble score at an 8.02, which is unacceptable and indicative of the issues that need to be addressed in the Operations department. This kind of situation not only affects my well-being but also the company's reputation and efficiency. We really need better support and protocols in place to ensure drivers like me feel safe and valued while doing our jobs.|1|2024-08-17 19:03:45

While I managed to deliver on time and didn’t face any serious issues during the trip, the stress level was uncomfortably high at an 8.2 out of 10, largely due to the unresolved issues I’ve raised before about scheduling and inadequate rest periods that seem to be falling on deaf ears. It’s frustrating to feel like my concerns aren’t being taken seriously, especially when they directly impact my ability to do my job efficiently and safely. I really hope we can get better communication and support moving forward.|1|2024-08-20 12:39:21
2492|107|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I’ve got to voice my frustration with the Finance department. First off, the delivery was late, and I was on the road for over 9 hours, which is insane for what should have been a straightforward trip. On top of that, I felt completely unsafe when I experienced an assault during the drive, which cranked my stress levels through the roof; I’m talking a solid 10 out of 10 on the stress scale. I can't shake the feeling that the chaos with the pay and lack of support is contributing to the overall trouble I’m facing out here—my trouble score hit a whopping 8 out of 10! It’s unacceptable, and I really need the Finance department to step up and sort this mess out so we can focus on driving safely and getting the job done.|1|2024-09-10 08:17:53
2493|107|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got to voice my frustration with the Operations department. The load I picked up was poorly organized, making it a real pain to secure everything properly, which added unnecessary stress to an already demanding trip—my stress level was sitting around an 8.7! Plus, there were inconsistencies in the GPS directions that led me on a detour, wasting precious time and fuel. I honestly expected better coordination, especially considering my seven years of experience; these hiccups shouldn't be happening. It feels like someone up top needs to step up and sort this out before it becomes a bigger issue for us drivers.|1|2024-09-18 12:40:45

While I managed to deliver on time, I encountered a few issues that could’ve been avoided with better guidance from HR. For starters, there was confusion about my scheduled breaks, which added unnecessary stress to my trip, rated at a 7 out of 10. Additionally, I felt that my recent requests for clarification on company policies have been largely ignored, leaving me feeling unsupported as I navigate this challenging job. It's disappointing to see such a lack of responsiveness from HR, especially when it directly impacts our well-being out on the road.|1|2024-09-19 05:48:25
2495|107|12|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 12, which took nearly 18.4 hours and was far from smooth. Not only did I not deliver on time, but I also had to deal with an unsettling situation where I was assaulted during the trip, adding to my already sky-high stress level of over 10 out of 10.

2496|107|12|1|1|I just wrapped up route 12, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. Everything went smoothly enough, and I delivered on time, but the lack of clear communication and support really got to me. I spent over 16 hours on the road, and it felt like I was driving blind half the time due to missing info about the delivery location and unexpected detours. It made for a stressful trip, and while my overall trouble score wasn’t too bad, my stress level hit an 8.5 because I had to figure things out on my own. It’s really not cool when we’re out there trying to do our jobs and can’t rely on the team back home.|1|2024-11-07 01:55:57

The stress was through the roof—my stress level hit a solid 10.5 out of 10. It feels like their communication is all over the place, and I can't get a straight answer about why my hours aren’t lining up with what I was promised. I’ve been driving for 7 years, and this kind of mess isn’t something I’ve ever faced before. I need them to get their act together because it’s really affecting my work.|1|2024-11-15 18:08:54
2499|107|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, which took me about 8.88 hours, and while I delivered on time, I need to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department. The communication was all over the place; I didn’t get proper updates on traffic conditions and detours, which made my stress level shoot up to an 8.68 during the trip. Plus, there were inconsistencies with the load information I received, which could have caused major delays if I hadn’t double-checked everything myself. Overall, my trouble score was low at 1.3, but that’s only because I’ve been in the game for 7 years and know how to handle the unexpected. This kind of lack of support from Ops isn’t cutting it.|1|2024-11-16 20:48:43
2500|107|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, which took me about 14.27 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious issues with the Human Resources department that need addressing. First off, the lack of communication from HR regarding my benefits and pay structure has been frustrating; I keep getting the run-around and vague answers that leave me more confused than before. Additionally, I’ve noticed that there’s a distinct lack of support when it comes to addressing driver concerns; it feels like our voices aren’t being heard, and it’s impacting morale on the road.

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I felt during the trip was off the charts, rating it a solid 9.7 out of 10, and that’s not just from the road. The lack of support and communication from HR regarding scheduling changes and pay discrepancies has made it incredibly difficult to focus on driving and safety. Instead of feeling valued for my 7 years of experience, I’m left feeling anxious and undervalued, which is unacceptable in this line of work.

First off, the load was poorly balanced, making it a challenge to handle on the road, and I had to constantly adjust my driving to keep it steady. Additionally, the directions provided were outdated, which added unnecessary stress to the trip and made me waste time figuring out where to go.

First off, my pay for this trip still isn’t reflected in my account, and it’s been over a week since I submitted my paperwork. On top of that, I noticed discrepancies in my mileage reimbursement that don’t match up with what was logged. I’ve been driving for 7 years, and this is the kind of hassle that just adds unnecessary stress—my stress level shot up to nearly 12 out of 10 during the trip, and the overall trouble score was way too high for something that should be straightforward.

It felt like no consideration was given to the driver’s well-being or the challenges on the road. I also had issues with the load not being properly secured, which made for a nerve-wracking ride. I've been in this game for 7 years, and I know we can do better than this.|1|2024-02-24 13:34:14
2519|109|13|1|1|I just finished route 13, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say that the experience was far from smooth. The Operations department really needs to get their act together; I spent way too much time sitting around waiting for paperwork and instructions that were either delayed or just plain missing. It added an unnecessary 2 hours to my trip and cranked my stress level up to an 8. I get that things can get hectic, but better communication and planning would save us drivers a lot of headaches. Please address these issues so we can focus on driving instead of dealing with avoidable problems.|1|2024-02-29 05:16:10
2520|109|28|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 28, and honestly, I need to express my frustration with the Operations department. The trip took nearly 18 hours, way longer than it should have, and to top it off, my delivery was late, which is completely unacceptable. On top of that, I faced an assault during the drive, which cranked my stress level up to a staggering 10.9 out of 10—there's no way any driver should have to deal with that while on the clock. The overall trouble I had on this route is just unacceptable and reflects poorly on our operations. I really hope you take these issues seriously and do something about it.|1|2024-03-21 09:52:51
2521|109|28|1|1|I just wrapped up route 28, and while the delivery was on time, I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department's handling of this trip. First off, the route was poorly planned, which led to a lot of unnecessary stress—my stress level sat at almost a 9 out of 10 for most of the trip. There were a couple of instances where I was left waiting at loading docks far longer than expected, which ate into my hours and threw my schedule off balance. Plus, the communication was spotty at best; I had trouble getting updates when I needed them. This kind of mismanagement isn’t just frustrating; it affects our ability to do our jobs efficiently and safely. I really think we need to reevaluate how routes are assigned and managed to avoid these issues in the future.|1|2024-03-23 22:08:24

While I delivered on time and everything went smoothly on the road, I've noticed that my mileage reimbursement hasn’t been processed correctly—again! This has happened before, and it’s really starting to get on my nerves. I’d appreciate it if someone would get their act together and ensure that these reimbursements are handled properly, as it’s crucial for us drivers to get paid accurately for our hard work.

Not only was the delivery late, but the stress level was off the charts at an 11/10, and to top it all off, I actually experienced an assault during the trip. The Finance department needs to get its act together because the lack of support and communication made this situation even worse. With an overall trouble score of 8/10, it’s clear something’s seriously wrong, and I think it’s high time we address these issues before someone gets hurt or we lose more deliveries.|1|2024-05-23 03:43:04

First off, I didn't make the delivery on time, which is frustrating enough, but what really pushed my stress level through the roof—hitting a staggering 16.18 out of 10—was the fact that I encountered an assault during the trip. The overall trouble score for this whole ordeal was an 8.81, and honestly, it made the entire drive feel like a nightmare. The Operations department really needs to step up and address these safety issues and ensure that drivers like me are better supported during such high-stress situations.

Not only did I face immense stress throughout the trip—rating a solid 10.4 out of 10—but I also experienced an assault during a rest stop, which made things even worse. I felt completely unsupported, and it seems like HR is dropping the ball on crucial safety protocols and communication.

While I delivered on time, the whole experience was more stressful than it should have been, with a stress level of about 8.3 out of 10. First off, the route planning was off; I hit some unexpected road closures that could have been avoided with better communication. Plus, I didn’t receive any updates about those closures until I was already on the road, which added unnecessary pressure to my trip.

Despite delivering on time and not facing any major hassles on the road, I've noticed inconsistencies in my pay for this trip that are really frustrating. It seems like my overtime hours weren't calculated correctly, which is especially disappointing after putting in such a long haul. I’ve been driving for over a decade now, and I expect better accuracy when it comes to compensation. It’s stressful enough out there without having to worry about whether I’m being paid what I deserve. Can someone please look into this ASAP?|1|2024-01-24 16:45:31

The route was poorly planned, leading to unexpected delays and traffic that could have easily been avoided with better communication and planning from Ops.

While I managed to complete the delivery on time, the experience was incredibly stressful, clocking in at over 13 hours on the road, and I felt like the support I needed was nowhere to be found. I’ve been driving for 11 years, and I’ve never seen such a lack of communication and resources when it comes to addressing driver concerns. It’s like we’re just numbers to them, and the stress level during this trip shot up to nearly a 12 out of 10 because of it.

It's disappointing that despite my years of experience, I still encounter these avoidable issues that could have been easily communicated beforehand to make the trip smoother.

It's disappointing that while I'm out here putting in the hard work and facing dangers, the financial side of things seems to be dropping the ball.|1|2024-05-01 16:28:04
2559|111|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and I need to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was off the charts—around 13 out of 10! The whole experience was marred by poor communication; I had to deal with last-minute changes to the delivery schedule that threw my whole rhythm off. Plus, I encountered a few unexpected detours that weren't noted in the route instructions, which cost me valuable time and added to the frustration. Overall, my trouble score was a 2.17, but it felt a lot worse in the moment. We really need better planning and communication to avoid these headaches on future trips!|1|2024-05-03 09:23:36
2560|111|26|1|1|I just wrapped up route 26, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced this trip. First off, it took me over 12 hours to complete, and I was nowhere near on time for the delivery, which is totally unacceptable in our line of work. To make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out—my stress level was off the charts at nearly 18 out of 10! Overall, I’d rate this whole experience as an 8.2 out of 10 on the trouble scale. I really think the Operations department needs to step up and address these safety concerns and time management issues because this isn’t just about me; it affects all of us drivers out there.|1|2024-05-06 15:12:19
2561|112|26|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department following my recent trip on route 26, which took me nearly 11.7 hours—way longer than it should have, and definitely not on time. Not only did I deal with a ridiculous amount of stress, rating a solid 10.7/10, but I also experienced an assault during the delivery. This isn't just about the physical safety; it’s the fact that I feel completely unsupported when it comes to handling these sorts of incidents. The overall trouble I faced was an 8.1/10, and it’s frustrating that the Finance department doesn’t seem to take these matters seriously or provide the necessary support and compensation for the time lost and the risks we face on the road.|1|2024-02-04 06:30:24
2562|112|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, and I gotta say, the whole experience was a bit of a mess. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was off the charts—almost a 9 out of 10. First off, the directions provided were pretty vague, leading me to waste time trying to find the right drop-off point. Then, the truck I was assigned had some mechanical issues that made the drive uncomfortable and nerve-wracking, which definitely added to my stress. Plus, I didn't receive timely updates from the Operations department when I had questions, which left me feeling unsupported. With all that, the overall trouble score was still low, but the anxiety and hassle were just not worth it. I really think the Ops team needs to step up their game to avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-02-06 05:39:26
2563|112|26|1|1|Hey Team, I just wrapped up Route 26, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say, the experience was frustrating. The Operations department really dropped the ball this time; the load was poorly organized, making it a hassle to secure everything properly, which added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level hit a 7.3 out of 10. On top of that, I faced some confusion with the routing instructions, which wasted about 30 minutes of my time. For someone with four years of driving experience, this shouldn't be happening. I hope you can take a look at these issues and make some improvements. Thanks!|1|2024-02-07 07:42:23

While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the planning and communication leading up to the trip were a mess. I spent over 27 hours on the road, and the lack of proper route guidance made for an unnecessarily stressful experience—my stress level hit a solid 7 out of 10! Plus, there were multiple instances where I had to deal with conflicting information about drop-off times, which left me feeling frustrated and on edge. It’s disappointing to see such a lack of organization, especially when we’re all working hard to keep things running smoothly out there.|1|2024-03-07 04:19:08

Not only did I have to deal with the stress of being behind schedule, but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level to an unbearable 10.8 out of 10. It’s absolutely unacceptable that I had to endure such a high level of trouble, scoring an overall 8.1, without any support or communication from Finance regarding my pay or compensation for these issues. I need answers and some accountability here because this whole experience has been beyond frustrating.|1|2024-03-24 16:38:23
2566|112|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, and I’m really frustrated with the Finance department over the way my trip was handled. Not only did I end up missing my delivery window, which is a huge deal, but the stress I felt during the trip was off the charts—like a solid 10 out of 10. I clocked in about 16.74 hours on the road, and instead of getting the support I need, I felt totally left in the dark about my pay and reimbursements. My overall trouble score was a 2.67, which isn’t great, and it feels like the Finance department isn’t doing their part to keep things running smoothly for us drivers. I really hope this gets sorted out because it’s making my job a lot harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-03-30 15:06:03
2567|112|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve gotta say the Finance department has really dropped the ball this time. I’ve been waiting on my reimbursement for fuel and tolls, and it’s been over a week since I submitted the paperwork. It’s frustrating because I had to front those costs out of my pocket, and with my stress level already hitting an 8 during the trip, this just adds to the hassle. I’m trying to keep things smooth on the road, but this delay is really making it tough. Can we get this sorted out ASAP?|1|2024-03-31 20:30:45

2569|112|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and I need to vent about a few things that really messed with my head during the trip. First off, the load was heavier than expected, and the weight distribution was off, making it hard to handle, especially on those winding roads. The GPS directions were also a hot mess; I ended up wasting time on detours due to outdated info, which ramped up my stress level to a solid 10.8 out of 10. And don't get me started on the lack of communication from the Operations department—no updates on rest stops or traffic issues, which left me feeling like I was driving blind. I managed to deliver on time, but the whole experience was way more trouble than it should have been, scoring a 3.1 on my trouble scale. I really think we need to address these issues, or else it’s going to keep driving us drivers crazy.|1|2024-04-12 23:44:18
2570|112|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, which took me a grueling 30.7 hours, and I feel compelled to voice my frustration with the Human Resources department. Despite delivering on time, the lack of support and communication from HR has been a real headache. I found myself feeling overwhelmed and stressed out during the trip, hitting a stress level of over 10 out of 10, mostly because of the endless bureaucratic red tape and unclear policies on time off and pay that make it nearly impossible to manage work-life balance. It’s disheartening to know that after four years on the road, I still can’t get straightforward answers when I need them most, and honestly, it’s affecting my performance and morale.|1|2024-04-19 12:13:48

First off, my expense reimbursements from my last few trips are still pending, and it’s getting frustrating. I’ve reached out multiple times, but it feels like I’m just getting the runaround.

I really hope you can get this sorted out soon because it’s becoming a big hassle.|1|2024-04-25 09:06:24
2572|112|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got some serious gripes with the Operations department. First off, the route plan was all kinds of messed up; the GPS directions were outdated and led me through a construction zone that added unnecessary stress and time to an already grueling 15.4-hour drive. Plus, the communication from dispatch was practically non-existent—there were times I felt completely in the dark about my next stop, which only cranked my stress level up to a 7 out of 10. It’s frustrating to put in long hours only to feel unsupported by the very team that’s supposed to help us succeed out here. Let’s get this sorted out so future trips don’t feel like such a headache.|1|2024-04-27 19:28:29

First off, the delivery was late, which is unacceptable considering the tight schedules we operate under; I spent a grueling 11.47 hours on the road, and the stress level was through the roof at around 12.58 out of 10. To make matters worse, I faced an assault while on the route, which not only jeopardized my safety but also added to the overall trouble score of 8.10 that I experienced during this nightmare of a trip. It feels like the Operations department really needs to step up and address these issues, because this is not how we should be operating.|1|2024-05-02 09:20:57
2574|112|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and I've got to say, the experience was far from pleasant, despite the delivery being on time. The Operations department really dropped the ball this time – there were multiple issues with the load assignment that made the trip unnecessarily stressful. First off, the routing was completely off; I hit a bunch of construction zones and detours that weren't mentioned in the pre-trip briefing, which piled on the hours and stress – I ended up clocking nearly 24 hours on the road! Plus, the communication from the operations team was lacking; I tried reaching out for clarification on some delivery instructions and got zero response. I know we all have tough days, but this level of disorganization is unacceptable and needs to get sorted out before I hit the road again.|1|2024-05-25 03:21:23

I’ve noticed some discrepancies in my pay that don’t add up, and it’s really starting to get under my skin. It’s like I’m constantly having to chase down answers or corrections, and it’s taking way too much of my time when I should be focusing on driving and doing my job right.

While I just wrapped up route 37 on time—after a grueling 12.15 hours with a stress level hovering around 8.78—I’ve noticed a serious lack of communication and support from HR. For example, I submitted a request for clarification on my benefits and got no response for over a week, which really added to my stress. Plus, when I tried to address a scheduling issue, I was met with vague answers that didn't help at all. It feels like there's no one to turn to when I need assistance, and it's affecting my overall morale on the job.

First off, the routing was off; I hit some unexpected road closures that added a good chunk of time to my journey, which made the already long drive of nearly 22 hours feel even longer. Plus, the lack of communication about those closures left me feeling blindsided and scrambling for alternatives. On top of that, the trailer I was given was in less than ideal condition, with a few maintenance issues that made handling it a challenge.

This is not how we should be operating.|1|2024-02-25 09:08:46
2599|114|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and honestly, I need to vent about the Finance department. Despite the fact that I delivered on time after nearly 22 grueling hours on the road, I’m still waiting on my reimbursement for fuel and tolls from my last trip, which is really starting to feel like a slap in the face. It's like they don't realize how expensive it is to keep this rig rolling. My stress level was already through the roof at over 10 during the trip, and now I’m dealing with more headaches trying to chase down the money I’m owed. Can someone please get their act together? This isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s affecting my bottom line and my sanity.|1|2024-02-28 01:53:46
2600|114|5|1|1|I just wrapped up route 5, and I need to share some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the trip ended up taking a whopping 14.83 hours, which felt unnecessarily long due to poor route planning and lack of communication about road conditions. I encountered multiple unexpected detours that weren’t relayed to me beforehand, leading to increased stress on the road—my stress level hit around 7.6 out of 10. Additionally, there was a lack of support when I needed to clarify my next steps at a couple of stops, which made things even more frustrating. I’ve been driving for 9 years now, and this kind of oversight is becoming a pattern, and it needs to be addressed to keep us drivers safe and efficient.|1|2024-03-01 03:14:44
2601|114|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and I gotta say, it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. First off, the delivery was late, which already put me on edge, but what really pushed my stress level through the roof—like a solid 10.36 out of 10—was the fact that I experienced an assault during the trip. I mean, seriously? How is this even acceptable? The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one; there was zero support when I needed help, and the whole situation left me feeling unsafe and frustrated. With an overall trouble score of 8.13, I can't help but feel that the lack of proper planning and support has put not only my safety but also my job at risk. This needs to be addressed ASAP!|1|2024-04-03 01:48:01
2602|114|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and honestly, I need to vent a bit about some major issues I faced with the Operations department. Even though I made the delivery on time, the entire trip felt like a rollercoaster of stress—my stress level was through the roof at about a 9.3! I had to deal with some pretty poor communication regarding my load assignment, which left me scrambling to figure out the proper drop-off procedures halfway through. Plus, there were unexpected detours that were never mentioned, making the trip longer than it should have been—my final time was just over 10.5 hours! I get that things can happen, but this kind of lack of coordination is really frustrating and needs to be addressed to prevent future headaches for drivers like me.|1|2024-04-03 17:16:16
2603|114|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, and while I’m glad the delivery was on time, I need to bring up some serious issues with the Operations department that made this trip pretty stressful. For starters, the load was poorly balanced, which made handling the trailer a real pain and cranked my stress level up to an 8.2 out of 10. Plus, there was a lack of communication regarding the route; I was sent through some construction zones that weren't mentioned in the pre-trip briefing, adding unnecessary delays and frustration. I’ve been driving for 9 years now, and I expect better coordination and support from Operations to ensure our trips go smoothly.|1|2024-04-05 14:48:17
2604|114|44|1|1|I just wrapped up route 44, which took me an exhausting 23.6 hours, and while I delivered on time without any major issues, I have to address some serious frustrations with the Finance department. It seems like there’s been a mix-up with my reimbursement for fuel expenses; I submitted my receipts over a week ago, and I still haven’t seen a dime. Communication has been absolute radio silence on their end, and it’s really adding to my stress on the road, which was already sitting at a 7.4 out of 10. I’ve been driving for nine years, and I’ve never had to deal with this kind of hassle over something that should be straightforward. I really hope someone can get this sorted out quickly because it’s affecting my focus and morale.|1|2024-04-07 19:32:55
2605|114|19|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I faced during route 19, which took me nearly 10.7 hours to complete, and unfortunately, I wasn’t able to deliver on time. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me feeling unsafe and incredibly stressed—my stress level hit a 10 out of 10. It’s frustrating to feel like the Finance department isn’t providing the support we need, especially when we’re out there dealing with not just the logistics but also personal safety concerns. The overall trouble score for this trip was 8.1 out of 10, and it’s high time we address these issues to ensure a safer and more efficient work environment.|1|2024-05-12 07:41:28
2606|114|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, which took nearly 19 hours, and I have to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department that made this trip way more stressful than it needed to be. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, I ran into a bunch of hiccups that should've been sorted out beforehand. First off, the load was misconfigured, causing me to spend extra time at the dock trying to get everything straightened out, which really ramped up my stress levels. Plus, there were no clear directions for the route, and I ended up wasting time trying to figure out the best path, which is ridiculous considering how much we rely on proper planning. It feels like there’s a lack of communication and organization on your end, and it’s really starting to take a toll on us drivers.|1|2024-05-13 07:40:18
2607|114|44|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 44, which took an exhausting 18.94 hours and ended up being late due to several issues. On top of that, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 11.64 out of 10. The lack of support from the Finance team during this ordeal was disappointing, especially when I needed assistance with the paperwork and compensation for the delays and the assault. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.06, and it's clear that the Finance department needs to step up their game to ensure drivers like me don't feel abandoned and stressed out on the road.|1|2024-05-24 14:41:31
2608|114|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and I've got to say, I'm really frustrated with the Human Resources department. While I managed to deliver on time after grinding through 11.4 hours on the road, the lack of support and communication from HR has been draining. It's like they don’t understand the stress we face out here—my stress level during this trip hit a solid 9.2, and it feels like they’re not doing enough to have our backs. I’ve raised concerns about scheduling and workload before, but it seems to fall on deaf ears. We need better support and accountability from HR, or it’s just going to keep wearing us down.|1|2024-06-01 16:26:47
2609|114|39|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing route 39, which took me over 10 hours, and I can’t shake off the feeling that the Finance department isn’t doing its job right. Not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed, pushing my stress level to nearly a 15 out of 10. To top it all off, the overall trouble score for this run was an 8.1, and it feels like the lack of support from Finance in addressing these kinds of issues is just adding to the chaos. I expect better communication and assistance, especially when we’re out there risking our safety.|1|2024-06-03 17:36:57
2610|114|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I have to voice my frustrations with the Operations department because the whole experience was a real headache. Even though I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof—12.46 out of 10! The communication was lousy; I didn’t get the right info about the pick-up times, which led to unnecessary delays and confusion at the docks. Plus, the trailer was in rough shape; I had to deal with a few maintenance issues that should’ve been sorted out before my trip. I’m not here to babysit equipment or constantly chase down my own info—this kind of mismanagement really needs to be addressed if we want to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-06-06 20:14:21
2611|114|39|1|1|I need to bring up some serious issues I've been having with the Finance department lately. I just wrapped up route 39, which took me about 9.5 hours, and while I delivered on time and didn’t face any major problems on the road, the stress level I felt during this trip was through the roof, mainly because of the constant delays in processing my reimbursements. It's frustrating to see my expenses piling up with no clear communication from Finance; I’ve been waiting way too long for what I'm owed, and it’s really adding unnecessary stress to my job. I love driving, but this financial mess is making it hard to stay motivated when I can’t get timely support.|1|2024-06-07 20:13:03
2612|114|5|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 5, and I've got to say, I’m really frustrated with the Finance department. Despite completing the delivery on time after 17.63 hours on the road, I’ve noticed some discrepancies in my pay that just don’t add up. The calculations seem off, and it feels like I'm not being compensated correctly for the hours I put in. I’ve raised this issue before, but nothing seems to get resolved, and it’s starting to wear on me, especially given my stress level during the trip was already at a 7.5. It’s tough enough dealing with the demands of the job without having to chase down the Finance team for what I’ve earned. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-06-13 13:41:42
2613|114|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I’ve got to say, it was a nightmare from start to finish. First off, I ended up delivering late, which is just unacceptable given the tight schedules we work with. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level through the roof—seriously, a solid 12 out of 10. On top of that, the overall trouble score I’d give this trip is about an 8.1, and that’s being generous. The Operations department needs to step up their game and ensure that drivers are not only safe but also supported in managing their routes effectively. This kind of nonsense can’t keep happening if we’re supposed to get our jobs done right!|1|2024-06-18 20:03:11
2614|114|19|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I've been facing with the Human Resources department. After completing route 19, which took me over 15 hours, I found myself dealing with a lack of support and communication that really added to my stress level, which was already pretty high at a 9.5 out of 10. I had some questions regarding my pay and benefits that I needed clarity on, but every time I reached out, it felt like I was hitting a brick wall—responses were either delayed or completely vague. It’s frustrating because I’m trying to do my job efficiently and stay on top of everything, but the HR team’s lack of responsiveness is making it a lot harder than it needs to be. I just want to feel supported and have my concerns heard, especially after putting in the effort to meet deadlines like I did on this trip.|1|2024-06-19 13:17:29
2615|114|5|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about the Finance department after my recent route 5 delivery that took just over 11 hours. While I completed the trip on time and didn’t face any major issues on the road, I’m really frustrated with the way my expenses were handled. I submitted my receipts for fuel and tolls promptly, but it took way too long to get any response, and when I finally did, some of my reimbursements were missing or incorrectly calculated. This has added unnecessary stress to what’s already a demanding job, and it just feels like nobody’s paying attention to the details. I expect better communication and accuracy—this kind of hassle shouldn’t be part of the gig!|1|2024-06-22 00:06:37
2616|114|5|1|1|I just finished Route 5, and I’m really fed up with how things went this time. Not only was my delivery late, but I also experienced an assault during the trip, which ramped my stress level up to a whopping 12 out of 10! The whole ordeal left me feeling unsafe and frustrated, especially given that I’ve been driving for 9 years and have never faced anything like this before. On top of that, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8 out of 10, which is unacceptable.

2617|114|5|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department following my recent route 5 trip, which I just wrapped up in 17.67 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I experienced during the trip was through the roof—9.63 out of 10! This isn't just about the workload; it’s about the lack of support and communication from HR regarding scheduling and route planning. I feel like I’m constantly left in the dark with no one to turn to when issues arise, and it’s draining. I’ve been driving for 9 years now, and this kind of disorganization is really taking a toll on my mental well-being. I hope you can understand where I’m coming from and take some steps to improve things.|1|2024-06-26 15:34:51
2618|114|34|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 34, which took me a grueling 23.58 hours, and while I did manage to make the delivery on time with minimal issues, I’ve got to say the lack of support from the Operations department was really frustrating. Communication was nearly non-existent during the trip, and I found myself driving in circles trying to figure out the best places to refuel and rest. On top of that, the GPS coordinates provided for some of the stops were way off, adding unnecessary stress to an already long haul. Honestly, with a stress level of 7.34 out of 10, I expected better coordination and backup from the team to help make these trips smoother. It feels like the Operations team needs to step up their game and provide us drivers with the proper tools and support we need out there.|1|2024-06-27 23:06:15

To add insult to injury, I experienced an assault during the trip, which sent my stress levels through the roof, rating a staggering 11 out of 10. This whole situation has left me feeling extremely unsafe and unsupported, and I can’t help but feel that the HR department has dropped the ball on addressing these critical issues.

2620|114|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say the experience was far from smooth thanks to some glaring issues in the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit some unexpected construction zones that weren’t flagged in my system, which added unnecessary stress and made me feel like I was driving blind. On top of that, the communication from Operations was practically non-existent—I tried reaching out for some clarification on a delivery detail, but it took forever to get a response. With a stress level at almost 9 out of 10, I really think we need better pre-trip briefings and timely updates to avoid this kind of hassle in the future.|1|2024-08-03 12:36:00
2621|114|5|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns after completing route 5, which took me a grueling 13.6 hours—way longer than it should have taken. Not only was I late with my delivery, but I also experienced a distressing situation where I felt unsafe, as I was assaulted during the trip. This whole ordeal pushed my stress level to an unbearable 10.3 out of 10, and I’m honestly shocked that the Operations department has let things get this bad. With an overall trouble score of 8.1, it’s clear something needs to change to ensure drivers’ safety and timely deliveries.

2622|114|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I’ve got to express my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress I faced during the trip was way too high, sitting at a 9.3 out of 10. The main issue was the lack of clear communication regarding my loading times and routes; I felt like I was left hanging without any support when unexpected delays popped up. It’s frustrating trying to navigate when I’m not getting the info I need upfront. This kind of disorganization is really stressful and needs to be addressed to make our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-08-28 17:58:34
2623|114|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, which took me 11 hours to complete, and while I delivered on time and didn’t face any major issues during the trip, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. I noticed that my mileage reimbursement was significantly lower than expected, and it’s really frustrating because I’ve been driving for 9 years and know how these things should work. It feels like I’m being shortchanged for the effort I put into this job, especially since I had a pretty high stress level on the road this time around. Can someone please look into this? I’d appreciate a prompt response so we can sort this out.|1|2024-08-30 23:03:00

During this trip, I faced a seriously distressing situation where I was assaulted by an individual at a delivery point, which ramped my stress level to an unbearable 10.9 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from HR regarding safety protocols and assistance in such situations is unacceptable. It feels like I’m driving a rig for a company that doesn’t care about its drivers’ well-being or safety, and with an overall trouble score of 8.06, it’s clear something needs to change urgently.|1|2024-09-13 19:50:48
2625|114|34|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the payment for my recent route 34. While I managed to complete the trip on time, the compensation doesn’t reflect the effort and time I put in—18.49 hours on the road is no cakewalk, and I expected a timely payment to match that commitment. Instead, I’m left waiting longer than usual for my dues, which just adds unnecessary stress to an already demanding job. It’s disappointing because I’ve always prided myself on my punctuality and dedication, and it's frustrating to feel undervalued when it comes to getting paid. I hope this issue gets sorted out soon so I can focus on driving, not chasing down my paycheck.|1|2024-09-15 04:27:39
2626|114|19|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding the issues I faced during my recent route 19. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, which was already stressing me out, but to top it off, I experienced an assault that made the whole trip unbearable. My stress level hit a ridiculous 12.5 out of 10, and overall, I’d rate this trip an 8.1 on the trouble scale. It’s unacceptable that after almost a decade on the road, I’m dealing with this kind of danger and lack of support.

First off, my reimbursement for expenses is still MIA, and I've been waiting way too long for that. Plus, there’s been a mix-up with my pay rate for this trip; I noticed a discrepancy that doesn’t add up at all. It’s super frustrating, especially considering the high stress I’ve been under during the trip, sitting at a 9.88 out of 10. I just want to get this sorted out so I can focus on hitting the road without worrying about money issues. Thanks!|1|2024-09-27 01:39:58

While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole trip took an exhausting 16.31 hours, which felt way longer than it should have. There were multiple instances of poor communication from the Operations department that added unnecessary stress to my drive, like unclear directions and last-minute changes that left me scrambling. My stress level was hovering around a 7.5 out of 10, which is way too high for a job that should be manageable.

2630|114|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to bring up some serious concerns with the Operations department. First off, the route planning seemed all over the place—there were multiple detours and roadblocks that weren’t communicated to me until I was already on the road, which added unnecessary stress and time to my trip, clocking in at over 20 hours. On top of that, the load I picked up had some discrepancies in weight that weren't noted in the paperwork, making it a hassle to manage. I felt like I was in the dark about a lot of things, which really ramped up my stress level to nearly an 8 out of 10.

While I did manage to deliver on time, the constant miscommunication regarding my pickup times and the lack of clarity on the route details made this trip unnecessarily stressful—my stress level was off the charts at almost 9.8 out of 10! I feel like there’s a serious disconnect between the planning and what drivers actually experience on the road. It’s tough to keep morale up when we’re left in the dark like this, and I really think it’s time for some improvements in how info is shared with us out here.|1|2024-12-25 07:19:31
2633|114|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and I gotta say, I've got some serious concerns about the Operations department that need addressing. First off, while I managed to get the delivery done on time, the whole trip took a whopping 16 hours, which is way longer than it should have been. I encountered multiple delays due to poor routing instructions, which had me driving in circles for a good chunk of that time. On top of that, the load I was given was poorly balanced, making the whole ride pretty stressful—I'd rate my stress level at about a 7.3 out of 10. I get that things can get hectic, but it feels like some basic planning could really help us avoid these headaches in the future.

While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was a nightmare due to lack of clear communication regarding my load and route.

2639|115|19|1|1|I wanted to bring up some serious issues I encountered during route 19 that need to be addressed by the Operations department. First, the load was poorly secured, making me nervous about shifting cargo, which added unnecessary stress on top of the long 16-hour drive. Additionally, the GPS directions were off-track, leading me through some questionable areas that wasted time and made the trip feel even longer. While I managed to make the delivery on time, it shouldn't come at the cost of safety or efficiency. A little more attention to detail on the dispatch side would go a long way in preventing this kind of hassle in the future.|1|2024-03-14 03:47:45
2640|115|16|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns about the Finance department after my recent trip on route 16, which took an exhausting 18.5 hours and was far from smooth. First off, the delivery was late, and I had to deal with a ton of unnecessary stress—my stress level was through the roof at nearly a 9.6! To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which really shook me up and added to my overall trouble score of 8.0. I feel like the Finance department needs to step up in supporting drivers like me, especially when we're out there facing such high levels of stress and unsafe situations. It's frustrating that after all the hard work, I still have to chase down issues that should be handled more efficiently.|1|2024-04-25 00:45:37
2641|115|9|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration regarding the Operations department after completing route 9, which took an exhausting 20.5 hours. Not only was the delivery late, but the lack of support from the Operations team during my trip was appalling. I encountered several issues that could have been easily resolved with better communication and planning, which left me feeling stressed throughout the journey, rating my stress level at around 8.7 out of 10. It’s disheartening to see how little regard there seems to be for the drivers on the road, especially when we’re out here working hard to meet deadlines. I hope the department can step up and address these problems so we don’t have to go through this again.|1|2024-05-04 01:03:28
2642|115|9|1|1|I just wrapped up route 9, which took me about 17.65 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I need to voice some frustrations with the HR department. First off, communication has been a nightmare—my pay hasn’t matched my hours for the last two trips, and when I reached out to HR for clarification, it took them forever to get back to me, leaving me in limbo and stressed out during my drives. I’m not one to complain often, but with a stress level of 7.23 out of 10, I shouldn't have to deal with this on top of the usual road challenges. It feels like they’re not giving us the support we need, and honestly, it’s starting to wear on me.|1|2024-05-05 00:14:12
2643|115|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department because this trip was a nightmare from start to finish. First off, it took me over 12 hours to complete a route that should have been much shorter, and to make things worse, I didn’t even get the delivery there on time. On top of that, I encountered an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level through the roof—seriously, I was at a 12.5 out of 10! The overall trouble I faced was an 8.1, and I can’t help but feel like the lack of support and proper route planning from Operations put me in unnecessary danger and stress. This kind of negligence needs to be addressed immediately.|1|2024-05-09 21:40:50
2644|115|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, which took me a grueling 17.65 hours, and I have to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. Although I managed to deliver on time, the lack of support and communication from HR has really been a pain. I’ve been dealing with some administrative issues that have been hanging over my head for weeks, and it feels like no one is taking my concerns seriously. My stress level was through the roof during this trip, hitting an 11.47 out of 10, and honestly, I feel like HR is just adding to the chaos instead of helping us drivers out. It's time for HR to step up and actually be available to resolve our issues instead of leaving us in the dark.|1|2024-05-15 04:02:07
2645|115|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and I need to vent about a few things that really messed with my head during the trip. Even though I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was off the charts—like a solid 9.5 out of 10. The Operations department dropped the ball big time with the routing; I hit so much traffic that it just felt like a never-ending nightmare. On top of that, I got zero communication about the delays I was facing, which only added to the frustration. I’ve got six years behind the wheel, and I know things can get hectic, but the lack of support and clear directions this time around was just unacceptable. It’s seriously affecting my ability to do my job efficiently.|1|2024-05-16 04:02:20
2646|115|9|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding some ongoing issues that need addressing. Despite successfully completing route 9 in just over 18 hours and delivering on time, I've found the support from HR lacking when it comes to addressing concerns about work-life balance and stress management. My stress level during this trip was a solid 7.8 out of 10, which isn’t ideal for anyone, and I feel like HR isn’t doing enough to provide the resources or support we need as drivers. It seems like our concerns fall on deaf ears, and the lack of communication and understanding from HR is really taking a toll on us. We need more proactive measures to ensure our well-being on the road.|1|2024-05-22 19:32:19
2647|115|16|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 16, which took me over 21 hours, and I’ve got to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department. Even though I made the delivery on time, I noticed some discrepancies in my pay for this trip that just don’t add up. It seems like there are deductions that I wasn’t informed about, and it’s really stressing me out—my stress level during the trip was already sitting at about a 7.5. I’ve been driving for six years now, and I’ve never had these kinds of issues before. Can someone please look into this and clear things up? It’s putting unnecessary pressure on me, and I’d appreciate a prompt response.|1|2024-05-24 13:12:11
2648|115|16|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns regarding the Finance department's handling of my recent route 16 trip, which took an exhausting 16.92 hours and ended up being late. On top of the stress of navigating that long haul, I also faced an assault during the trip that made things even worse—my stress level was through the roof at a 10.17 out of 10. To add insult to injury, the financial compensation and support I received from the department has been inadequate, leading to an overall trouble score of 8.04 out of 10 for this entire ordeal. It's frustrating that while I'm out there risking my safety and dealing with such high levels of stress, the Finance team doesn't seem to have my back when it comes to fair compensation and timely support. This needs to be addressed immediately!|1|2024-06-18 20:54:49
2649|115|43|1|1|I just wrapped up route 43, which took me about 5.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the routing was all over the place, leading to unnecessary stress and confusion; it feels like nobody’s double-checking these routes before sending us out. On top of that, I encountered a couple of delays at the drop-off point that could have been avoided with better communication from dispatch. My stress level peaked at over 8 out of 10 during the trip, which is just not acceptable when I’m trying to do my job efficiently. It’s frustrating to deal with these avoidable issues, and I really think we need to step up our game to make things smoother for drivers like me.|1|2024-06-22 05:33:38
2650|115|9|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent trip on route 9, which took an exhausting 17.7 hours and, to make matters worse, was not delivered on time. Not only did I have to deal with a high stress level, hitting a solid 9.7 out of 10, but I also experienced an assault during the journey that left me shaken and questioning my safety while on the road. The overall trouble score for this trip was an alarming 8.0 out of 10, and I can’t help but feel that the lack of proper communication and support from Operations contributed significantly to this nightmare. I really hope we can address these issues because this kind of experience is unacceptable for anyone in our line of work.|1|2024-09-22 07:04:32
2651|115|43|1|1|I just wrapped up route 43, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. First off, the load was way heavier than what was communicated, which made the trip a lot more stressful than it needed to be—my stress level hit a solid 7.87 out of 10. I ended up arriving late because of the unexpected weight and the longer-than-predicted travel time of nearly 7 hours. It really feels like there’s a lack of coordination when it comes to preparing loads for drivers. I’m all for doing my job, but when the details are off, it creates a ripple effect that makes it tough for everyone involved. We need better communication and planning on your end to avoid these issues moving forward.|1|2024-09-23 13:06:09
2652|115|32|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on route 32, which took an exhausting 12.4 hours and ended up being late for delivery. Not only was I stressed to the max throughout the trip, with my stress level hitting about 9.5 out of 10, but I also faced a disturbing situation where I was assaulted. This whole experience was a nightmare, and the overall trouble score I’d rate this trip is around 8 out of 10, largely due to the lack of support and communication from the Finance team regarding the delays and issues I faced. I really expected better, especially considering my six years on the road – we need to get our act together to ensure drivers like me aren’t left in such a tough spot.|1|2024-12-09 21:13:03
2653|115|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, which took me a grueling 15 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time without any major issues or assaults, I need to bring up some serious concerns about the Human Resources department. The lack of support and communication from HR has been frustrating, especially when I had some questions about my benefits and time off after this long trip. I feel like I’m just another number in the system, and it’s really affecting my morale on the road. It shouldn’t be this hard to get basic information or feel valued as a driver, especially with the stress levels we deal with out here.|1|2024-12-11 16:09:47
2654|115|32|1|1|I’m writing to express my serious concerns regarding the Finance department after my recent route 32, which took an exhausting 11.56 hours, and didn’t even make it on time. On top of that, I had to deal with an assault during the trip, which left me feeling incredibly unsafe and put my stress level through the roof at nearly a 10/10. This whole experience was a nightmare, and the trouble I faced was compounded by a lack of support from Finance when I tried to address the costs associated with the delay and the distressing situation. I expect better communication and assistance from the Finance team, especially when safety and timely deliveries are on the line.|1|2025-01-12 16:11:14
2655|115|25|1|1|I just wrapped up route 25, which took me over 10 hours, and I really need to address some frustrations I've been having with the Human Resources department. While the delivery was on time and I didn’t face any major issues during the trip, I can't shake off the feeling that HR is dropping the ball when it comes to communication and support for us drivers. I've had a few instances lately where I reached out with questions or concerns, and the responses have been slow or vague at best. It’s really stressing me out, and with a stress level of almost 8 during my trip, I can’t help but think that better support from HR could make a world of difference. We need a team that’s actually on our side and responsive to our needs, not just an afterthought in the process.|1|2025-01-15 01:07:35
2656|115|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, and honestly, it was a nightmare from start to finish. Not only was I late on delivery, which is frustrating enough, but I also faced an assault that really shook me up. The stress level was off the charts, hitting an 11.6 out of 10, and the overall trouble score was an 8.0, which is unacceptable. I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball on this one—there were no clear instructions, and I was left navigating a mess without proper support. This isn't just about a late delivery; it's about safety and proper planning, and I need to see some changes made.|1|2025-01-20 21:04:31
2657|115|43|1|1|I just wrapped up route 43, which took me just under 5 hours, and while the delivery was on time, I need to address some serious issues with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses has not been processed, and it’s been over two weeks since I submitted my receipts. On top of that, I noticed discrepancies in my pay stub that don’t match up with the hours I worked or the bonuses I was promised for this run. Honestly, it’s really frustrating because my stress levels are already high enough out here, and dealing with these financial hiccups just adds to it. I’m hoping you can look into this ASAP because it’s affecting my morale and overall experience on the road.|1|2025-01-22 19:52:02
2658|115|9|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 9, which took me about 15.67 hours, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on the road, and I delivered on time, but I’ve been having major issues with my pay for this trip. My reimbursements and overtime calculations seem way off, and despite my efforts to reach out, I haven’t gotten any clear answers or support back from anyone. I'm feeling pretty stressed about this—it's not just about the money, but the lack of communication is really bothering me. Can someone please look into this? Thanks.|1|2025-01-23 16:25:52

On top of that, I faced an assault during the trip, which cranked my stress level to about a 9.8 out of 10. The lack of support or communication from Finance when I needed it most really added to the overall trouble I experienced, scoring around 8.1 on my trouble meter. It feels like there's a disconnect, and I just can't shake the feeling that the Finance team isn't doing enough to support drivers like me who are out there risking it all.|1|2024-03-07 00:17:49
2660|116|35|1|1|I just wrapped up route 35, which took me a little over 9 hours, and while I made the delivery on time, I’ve got to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. First off, the lack of clear communication before the trip left me scrambling for info on the drop-off location, which isn’t acceptable when we’re out there trying to stick to tight schedules. Also, I had to deal with some outdated GPS info that led me to a construction zone, adding unnecessary stress to an already tight timeline. It’s these kinds of oversights that push my stress level up to nearly an 8 out of 10, and it shouldn’t have to be that way. I know we’re all trying to do our jobs, but better coordination and updated info would really help keep us on track and reduce headaches on the road.|1|2024-03-13 04:20:08
2661|116|5|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department following my recent trip on route 5, which took me over 10.7 hours—way longer than it should have. Not only did I miss the delivery window, but I also faced a seriously stressful situation during the trip, which I’d rate at a solid 11 out of 10. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault while on the road, which only added to my already high trouble score of 8 out of 10. It feels like the Finance department isn't taking into account the real-life challenges we face out here, and it's affecting not just my work but my peace of mind as well. This needs to be addressed immediately before it escalates further.|1|2024-04-06 00:25:09
2662|116|37|1|1|I just wrapped up route 37, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level throughout the trip was through the roof—about a 9.6 out of 10. The issue mainly stemmed from the lack of clear communication regarding my stops and the confusing directions I received; it felt like I was navigating a maze rather than following a straightforward route. I also encountered unexpected delays due to poorly scheduled pickups that were supposed to be ready, but they weren’t, which wasted my time and added unnecessary pressure. Overall, my trouble score was low at 1.8, but the operational hiccups seriously impacted my experience and left me feeling like I was driving in the dark without a map.|1|2024-04-11 02:37:02
2663|116|5|1|1|I just wrapped up route 5, which took me a grueling 16 hours, and while I delivered on time without any major issues, I can't help but feel frustrated with the Finance department. I've noticed some discrepancies in my pay for this trip, and it's really starting to add up. The figures they provided don’t match my calculations, and I’m left scratching my head trying to figure out where the missing dollars went. I’ve reached out for clarification but haven’t received a response, which is just adding to my stress after a long haul. I expect better communication and accuracy, especially after putting in such long hours on the road.|1|2024-04-13 06:35:13

2665|116|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, and while I made the delivery on time, I've got to say the experience was frustrating enough to warrant a complaint. The Operations department really dropped the ball on a few key details that made this trip way more stressful than it needed to be. For starters, the navigation instructions were outdated, and I ended up taking a longer route that added unnecessary hours to my trip. The lack of communication about a road closure also threw a wrench in my schedule, forcing me to scramble for an alternate route. Overall, my stress level hit an 8 out of 10, and I think it’s high time the Operations team gets their act together to ensure drivers have accurate information and support during their routes.|1|2024-05-06 08:58:48

Not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also faced an assault that had my stress level through the roof at a solid 10 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that the Operations department didn't provide proper route planning or safety measures, which would have helped avoid this mess.

It seems like every time I submit my expenses, there are delays and inconsistencies that leave me scratching my head. For instance, my last reimbursement took over two weeks to process, and I still haven't received a clear explanation for the holdup. This kind of inefficiency adds unnecessary stress on top of the already high-pressure job we do, and at a stress level of around 8, I really can't afford any more hassle. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-09-16 03:19:18
2668|116|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit traffic that could have been avoided if better alternatives were considered. I also had issues with the load weight not matching what was on the paperwork, which made for some extra stress on my end—my stress level was around a 7 out of 10 for most of the trip. The communication from Ops was practically non-existent when I tried to get clarity on the route changes, leaving me feeling pretty frustrated. Overall, it felt like a lack of organization and support, which is not what I expect from our team.|1|2024-09-18 05:27:54

Despite delivering on time and not having any major issues on the road, I've noticed that my reimbursement for fuel and tolls is way off compared to what I actually spent. It feels like I'm constantly chasing down missing expenses, and it’s adding unnecessary stress to my job—my stress level was through the roof this trip, hitting about 10.6 out of 10!

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress level was through the roof at a 7.56 out of 10. The issue seems to stem from poor communication regarding my load and route changes that weren’t relayed to me until I was already en route, leading to unnecessary delays and confusion at the delivery point. I also felt like the paperwork was a mess—missing documents made the whole process a hassle. It’s disappointing when the operations side of things makes an already long trip feel even longer and more stressful than it needs to be.|1|2024-10-03 09:18:33

Also, there was no clear communication about the payment timeline, which left me in the dark about when to expect my check. On top of all that, I had to deal with some unexpected delays in processing my expenses, which just added to my stress level during the trip, already at a solid 11.65 out of 10.

2679|118|9|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I encountered during route 9, which took an exhausting 12.2 hours and was not delivered on time. Not only did I face a ridiculous amount of stress—peaking at a 10.2 out of 10—but I was also assaulted during the trip, which is completely unacceptable. On top of that, I feel like the Finance department is dropping the ball when it comes to compensating drivers for these kinds of situations and the extra hours we put in with no support. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and it’s clear that something needs to change to ensure that we’re not left hanging when things go sideways.|1|2024-03-05 00:40:21
2680|118|9|1|1|I just wrapped up route 9, which took me over 17 hours, and I’ve gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department. Everything went smoothly on the road—delivered on time and no incidents to report—but when I got back, I found my reimbursement for fuel and tolls was way off. I don't know if there's a mix-up on their end, but it feels like I’m not getting what I’m owed for the expenses I racked up during this trip. It’s stressful enough out there, and I shouldn’t have to chase down money that’s rightfully mine. Can someone please look into this?|1|2024-03-08 20:54:07
2681|118|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication about the route changes really threw me off. I spent almost 8.7 hours on the road, and the stress level was higher than it should've been—around a 7.5 out of 10. I encountered unexpected detours that weren't communicated until I was already on the road, which made it tough to stick to my schedule. It feels like there’s a serious disconnect between planning and execution, and it’s putting unnecessary pressure on drivers like me. We need better updates and clarity to make our jobs easier and keep everything running smoothly.|1|2024-03-10 19:47:42

On top of that, the overall trouble score for this trip was an alarming 8.0, indicating that this isn't just a one-off issue but a systemic problem that needs addressing. The operations department really needs to step up because this kind of experience is unacceptable and makes it hard to feel safe or valued as a driver.|1|2024-05-31 04:14:00

2685|118|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, which took me over 12 hours to complete, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was riddled with issues that made it a nightmare. First off, the lack of proper communication regarding the pickup times led to unnecessary waiting, which cranked my stress level up to a 9.4 out of 10. Plus, the GPS directions provided were outdated and took me through some really sketchy back roads, which I don’t think is safe for anyone.

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, there were some serious communication issues that caused unnecessary stress during the trip, with my stress level hitting a 7.6 out of 10. For starters, the route directions were confusing and didn’t match up with what was on my GPS, which wasted a lot of my time trying to figure out the best way to go. Also, there were discrepancies with the loading times that weren’t communicated properly, leaving me waiting longer than I should have. It’s frustrating because while my overall trouble score was low, these issues still added a ton of stress to my journey that could easily be avoided with better coordination and clear communication from Operations.|1|2024-07-18 12:10:50

I felt completely unsafe and unsupported, which has left me incredibly frustrated with the Operations department for not addressing these serious safety issues.

It seems like there's been a mix-up with my mileage reimbursement; I’ve noticed discrepancies that don’t match up with the logs I submitted, and it’s really stressing me out—my stress level was already sky-high at 9.44/10 during the trip.

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and angry; it’s unacceptable that we’re not better protected out here. My stress level hit a solid 10.77/10, and I’d rate my overall trouble at an 8.10/10. This isn’t just about my experience; it’s about the safety and well-being of all drivers.

2691|118|4|1|1|I just wrapped up route 4, and I need to express my frustration with the Operations department. While I delivered the load on time, the journey was riddled with problems that really ramped up my stress levels to an 8.6 out of 10. First, the GPS directions were off, leading me to take longer, more complicated routes that added unnecessary hours to my trip. On top of that, I encountered poorly maintained rest areas that were supposed to be safe and convenient for truckers, but instead were dirty and lacking basic facilities. This kind of mismanagement makes the job so much harder than it needs to be, and it’s not just about getting from point A to B; it’s about doing it efficiently and safely. I really think Operations needs to step up and address these issues so drivers like me can do our jobs without the extra headaches.|1|2024-09-09 00:30:44

While I managed to complete the delivery on time, which should have been a straightforward process, I ran into some frustrating complications with my pay that I can't ignore.

It took me almost 9 hours to complete, and I didn’t even make the delivery on time, which is really frustrating. On top of that, I encountered some seriously sketchy behavior from another driver who actually assaulted me during a stop; it was terrifying and completely unnecessary. My stress level during the trip was off the charts at a 9.7, and I can't help but feel like the Operations department needs to step up their game to ensure our safety and timely deliveries. This whole experience has left me feeling really uneasy about the job.|1|2024-01-14 23:22:41
2720|120|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and honestly, it was one of the most stressful trips I’ve had in my six years as a driver. While I managed to deliver on time, the Operations department really dropped the ball this time. The directions I received were a mess, leading to unnecessary detours that added hours to my trip, which was already longer than it needed to be at over 16 hours. Plus, the lack of communication about road closures and traffic conditions left me feeling completely unprepared, ramping my stress level up to almost a 9.5. I can’t keep doing this if the planning isn’t up to par; it’s frustrating and exhausting, and it’s affecting my overall performance.|1|2024-01-15 17:57:05
2721|120|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, which took me nearly 17 hours, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress levels were through the roof, hitting an 8.8 out of 10, mainly due to the lack of support during this trip. There were several issues that could’ve been easily resolved if HR had been more responsive—like delayed paperwork and unclear communication about my route specifics. It’s just disappointing to feel like I’m out here on my own when I know there are people in HR who should be making our lives easier, not adding to our stress.|1|2024-01-16 17:45:24

Although I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip felt way more stressful than it should have been—my stress level was sitting at an 8.3 out of 10. The route was poorly planned; I hit multiple road closures that weren't communicated ahead of time, which forced me to take longer detours and nearly put me over my hours of service limit. Plus, the truck I was assigned had a bunch of maintenance issues that should have been sorted out before my trip. This kind of mismanagement is really getting old and makes my job a lot harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-01-21 17:32:19

The stress level was through the roof, hitting about 13 out of 10, and to make matters worse, I encountered an assault during the trip that left me shaken. Honestly, the lack of support from the Finance department when it comes to handling these stressful situations is unacceptable, and it contributed significantly to the overall trouble I experienced, which I’d rate at around 8 out of 10.

While I did manage to deliver on time, the entire trip was a nightmare, and my stress level hit a solid 10.6 out of 10. The lack of communication regarding road conditions made it nearly impossible to navigate, and the scheduling felt completely off, leading to unnecessary delays at pick-up points despite being on time. Not to mention, the trailer issues I encountered were frustrating, and I spent way too much time dealing with equipment that shouldn’t have been a problem. This kind of oversight is making my job way harder than it needs to be, and it really needs to be addressed so we can keep our sanity on the road.|1|2024-01-31 07:04:41

Although I managed to make the delivery on time, the entire trip was riddled with issues that made it way more stressful than it needed to be. For starters, the route provided was poorly planned, leading to unnecessary detours and longer wait times at loading docks. Plus, there was a lack of communication regarding the delivery schedule, which left me in the dark about potential delays. I felt like I was driving blind and it really ramped up my stress level to an 8.2 out of 10.

Despite my timely delivery, I've noticed that my compensation doesn't reflect what was promised, and I've been left hanging without a clear explanation.

They messed up my pay again; I noticed discrepancies in my mileage compensation that don’t match up with what I actually drove. It’s frustrating because I rely on that money to keep everything running smoothly on my end, and this isn’t the first time this has happened. I’ve had to chase after these issues before, and it’s honestly getting old — I shouldn’t have to double-check my pay every time I finish a route.

While I managed to make the delivery on time, the stress level was through the roof at a solid 9.36 out of 10 because of the constant mishaps with the Operations department. The route was riddled with lack of proper communication regarding load assignments, which led to delays in getting the right paperwork and a frustrating last-minute change in delivery instructions that almost threw me off schedule.

First off, the load I picked up was poorly secured, which made for a nerve-wracking drive for the entire 12.77 hours. I had to stop multiple times to check and adjust it, which added unnecessary stress—my stress level hit an 8 out of 10 at one point!

It’s stressful enough out on the road without having to chase down my pay. Can we please get this sorted out so I can focus on driving instead of worrying about my paycheck?|1|2024-10-17 09:02:16
2760|121|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, which took me about 6.42 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and I got it there on time, I need to bring up some serious issues with the Human Resources department that have been driving me up the wall. First off, their communication is absolutely terrible; I've reached out multiple times about my scheduling and haven't received any clear responses, which adds unnecessary stress to my job—my stress level was at an 8.97 during this trip! Additionally, there’s been a lack of support when it comes to addressing concerns about equipment maintenance; I had a minor issue with the trailer that I reported weeks ago, but it still hasn’t been resolved. This kind of neglect really impacts our ability to do our jobs effectively and safely, and it’s frustrating to feel like HR isn’t listening to us drivers who are out here putting in the work every day.|1|2024-10-18 15:12:14
2761|121|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the trip was a real headache, taking over 23 hours and pushing my stress level to nearly a 9 out of 10. The route planning was all over the place, leading to unexpected delays and frustrating detours that could’ve been easily avoided with better communication and planning. Plus, the lack of timely updates on road conditions was a major pain, making it hard to stay on track. Overall, the trouble I encountered during this run really makes me question the effectiveness of our operations team. We need to get our act together if we want to keep things running smoothly out here!|1|2024-10-19 20:26:33
2762|121|14|1|1|I just wrapped up route 14, and I gotta say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the entire trip felt like a rollercoaster of unnecessary stress and miscommunication. The route planning was all over the place, which added a good chunk of time to my trip—18.7 hours, come on! Plus, I ran into a couple of issues with the loading dock; it was a mess, and I had to waste time sorting it out. It's like no one is on the same page, and that just makes my job way harder than it needs to be. Can we please get better coordination and clearer instructions? It shouldn’t feel this stressful just to get the job done!|1|2024-10-21 18:44:16
2763|121|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the trip itself was unnecessarily stressful, with a level of 7 out of 10, mainly due to the lack of clear communication regarding my scheduled stops and the frequent changes in delivery details that seemed to pop up last minute. I spent nearly 20 hours on the road, and the overall trouble score of 2.8 out of 10 indicates that there were definitely some avoidable issues. It feels like the Operations team isn't fully considering the impact of their decisions on drivers like me, and it’s really affecting morale out here. Let's get it sorted out!|1|2024-11-10 00:51:32
2764|121|16|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 16, and honestly, it was a nightmare. The delivery was late, and I ended up driving for over 18 hours, which is way longer than it should’ve been. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out of my mind, scoring my stress level a solid 10.8 out of 10. I’m seriously frustrated with the Operations department for not addressing these safety concerns and for the poor planning that led to this mess.

2765|121|20|1|1|I just wrapped up route 20, which took me a grueling 17.74 hours, and honestly, it was a nightmare. While I managed to deliver on time, the Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. The route was poorly planned, with multiple unexpected detours that added unnecessary stress, pushing my stress level to a near-breaking point of 9.8 out of 10. I also faced issues with the load; it was unbalanced and made the drive even more nerve-wracking.

I felt like I was left in the dark with no guidance on the delays I encountered, and honestly, the stress level was through the roof at an 8.8 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that after three years on the job, I’m still facing issues that should’ve been addressed long ago.

2767|121|29|1|1|I just wrapped up route 29, which took me about 6.67 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time with a stress level of 7 out of 10, I need to address some serious issues with the Human Resources department. First off, there’s a lack of communication regarding benefits and pay—every time I try to get clarity, I’m met with vague responses or no responses at all. It makes it hard to feel valued when I can't even get straight answers about my compensation or the support available for us drivers. This has really been weighing on me and adds unnecessary stress, especially when we’re out on the road trying to do our jobs. It’s frustrating, and I think it’s high time HR stepped up to improve their communication and support for us.|1|2024-12-20 04:17:21

Not only was I late on delivery, but I also faced a distressing situation where I was assaulted during the trip, ramping my stress level to an unbearable 12.89 out of 10.

While I managed to deliver on time, the Operations department seriously dropped the ball this time. The route info was a mess, with wrong waypoints and confusing directions that added unnecessary stress to an already long trip—19.68 hours, mind you!

2771|122|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, and I really need to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. First off, the communication was a complete mess—there were several times I was left hanging without updates on necessary stops, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip of over 18 hours. My stress level was through the roof, sitting at an 11 out of 10, mostly because I had to juggle navigating tight schedules without clear info from dispatch. Plus, there were discrepancies with the load weights I was given, which made me worried about compliance and safety.

Despite the successful delivery, I encountered several issues with my expenses and reimbursements that have left me feeling undervalued. The mileage I submitted didn’t match the compensation I received, and it took way too long for anyone to respond to my queries about it.

I really hope you can address these issues promptly.|1|2024-03-30 00:30:23

While I managed to deliver on time and avoided any serious issues, I encountered several administrative hiccups that made the trip more stressful than it needed to be. For starters, my schedule was not updated in the system, leading to confusion about my pick-up times, which caused me to spend unnecessary time waiting. Additionally, I still haven’t received my reimbursement for fuel expenses from my last haul, despite multiple follow-ups. It feels like there’s a real disconnect between drivers and HR, and it’s starting to impact our morale.

2800|122|45|1|1|I just wrapped up route 45, which took me a grueling 17.62 hours, and while the delivery was on time, I’m really frustrated with the Finance department. First off, my pay for this trip hasn’t been processed correctly; I’m missing a few hours that I clearly logged. It’s like they don’t even bother checking the details before cutting the checks. On top of that, I had to deal with a delayed reimbursement for my fuel expenses that’s been dragging on for weeks. The stress level during the trip was already high at around 8.68, and now I’m left feeling even more agitated because of this finance mess. Can we please get these issues sorted out?

First off, the load info they sent me was incomplete, which made my planning a nightmare; I spent way too much time double-checking details that should've been clear from the start. Additionally, there were discrepancies with the fuel reimbursement rates—they didn’t match what I actually spent, leaving me out of pocket. And let’s not even get started on the lack of communication when I tried to reach out for clarification; it took ages to get a response, which only added to my stress level during the trip that was already sitting at a 7.7 out of 10. I really think they need to step up their game to make our jobs easier, because this is just unacceptable.|1|2024-11-11 04:15:20

While I managed to deliver on time, the trip felt unnecessarily stressful, with a stress level around 8.9 out of 10. I encountered multiple delays due to poor communication about road conditions and traffic updates, which left me feeling ill-prepared. On top of that, the lack of clarity regarding my load assignments made it tough to plan my stops efficiently.

2841|125|30|1|1|I just wrapped up route 30, which took me 12.76 hours, and while I delivered on time, I need to vent about some serious issues with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel hasn't been processed yet, even though I submitted all the necessary paperwork weeks ago. It’s frustrating because fuel prices are skyrocketing, and I’m left waiting for my hard-earned money. Plus, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip—there’s a couple of hours missing that I worked, and it’s really messing with my budget. I get that mistakes happen, but the lack of communication and urgency from Finance is driving my stress level up to an 8 out of 10. It feels like they just don’t care about the drivers who keep this company moving!|1|2024-11-29 04:26:21

The stress was through the roof, hitting a 9.99 out of 10, and to top it all off, I experienced an assault during the trip which made things even worse.

I had to spend way too much time on the phone sorting out discrepancies with my pay that seemed to stem from errors on their end. The stress level during the trip was already high—around an 8 out of 10—thanks to traffic and delays, and having to deal with financial issues on top of that was just the cherry on the cake.

2844|125|16|1|1|I just wrapped up route 16, which took me a solid 20.18 hours, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I’ve got to raise some concerns about the Operations department. First off, the load I was given was way heavier than what was listed in the manifest, which made handling it a real pain and contributed to my stress level being around a 7.5 out of 10. Plus, there were some major issues with the routing; I ended up stuck in traffic for way longer than necessary because the GPS was directing me through a construction zone that wasn't even mentioned in the briefing. Overall, my trouble score was low, but these annoyances need addressing to make our trips smoother in the future.|1|2025-01-10 09:32:06

2848|126|25|1|1|I just wrapped up route 25, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say the Operations department needs to get their act together. The communication was all over the place—had to chase down information about my next stop, which made an already long drive feel even longer.

Not only did I deal with an insane amount of stress—rated a solid 10/10—but I also faced an assault during the trip that made things even worse.

I spent nearly 20 hours on the road, and the stress level was through the roof—about a 9.5 out of 10.

It’s becoming a pattern, and it's hard to stay focused when I’m constantly battling these operational hiccups. Can we get some better communication and planning in place, please?|1|2024-09-16 14:59:15
2881|127|17|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing Route 17, which took just over 10 hours. While I delivered on time and managed to keep my stress level at a reasonable score of 7.5, the financial discrepancies I encountered during this trip were unacceptable. My expense reimbursements were not processed correctly, and I’ve been left waiting for a resolution that has dragged on for far too long. It’s incredibly frustrating to have to chase down what is rightfully mine after working hard to meet my delivery deadlines. I expect better communication and quicker turnaround on these matters, as it’s affecting my ability to focus on my driving duties.|1|2024-09-17 06:37:15
2882|127|19|1|1|I just wrapped up route 19, and I’ve got to tell you, it was a nightmare. First off, I didn’t deliver on time, which is a huge deal for us in this line of work. On top of that, I faced a crazy amount of stress—like, my stress level hit a 13 out of 10! The worst part was the incident where I was assaulted during the trip, which honestly made it feel more like a horror movie than a job. Overall, my trouble score was an 8 out of 10, and it's clear that the Operations department needs to step up their game. We can’t keep putting drivers in these kinds of situations without support.|1|2024-09-20 05:59:43
2883|127|7|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 7, which took me a grueling 12.86 hours, and I've got to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While my delivery was on time, the lack of communication regarding last-minute changes to my load was ridiculous; I had to scramble to adjust my schedule. Plus, the routing directions were off, leading me through a construction zone that added unnecessary stress to an already long trip—my stress level hit a solid 10.27 out of 10! It's really disappointing when the team behind the scenes doesn't seem to consider the drivers' experience. Overall, it’s just been a mess, and I hope something changes because this is not how it should be.|1|2024-09-21 18:29:50

2885|127|7|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 7, which took me a staggering 10.74 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level I experienced was off the charts—11.97 out of 10! The routing was a mess, sending me through congested areas during peak hours that could have easily been avoided with better planning. Plus, the lack of communication about road closures and detours made an already long trip even more unbearable. I’ve been driving for 9 years, and I’ve never felt this overwhelmed on a route before. We need better coordination and support from the Operations team to avoid these kinds of issues in the future.|1|2024-09-26 22:39:04
2886|127|17|1|1|I just wrapped up route 17, and I need to vent about some serious issues with the Operations department that made this trip way more stressful than it should have been. First off, the routing was completely off, which added unnecessary time to my drive, clocking in at over 10 hours when it should have been smoother. The load was poorly balanced, causing the truck to sway and making it difficult to handle, which cranked my stress level up to a 9. I also had to deal with outdated paperwork that messed with my delivery schedule, even though I made it on time. It feels like nobody in Ops is paying attention to the details that keep us safe and efficient out there, and I really hope these issues get sorted out before the next trip.|1|2024-09-28 23:15:48
2887|127|15|1|1|I need to bring to your attention some serious issues I faced on Route 15 that really need addressing.

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the journey that left me shaken and stressed to the max—my stress level was at an 11.5 out of 10!

It's been over a week since I submitted my expenses, and the lack of communication is driving me nuts. I’m feeling pretty stressed out—like a 9.5 on the stress scale—because I rely on that money to manage my bills, and it shouldn't take this long. Can someone please get this sorted out? It's making my job a lot harder than it needs to be. Thanks.|1|2024-12-25 14:36:15
2889|127|17|1|1|I just finished route 17, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. The communication was a mess—there were several discrepancies with the load details that led to unnecessary stress during the trip, which was already at a solid 7.5 on my stress scale. I encountered a couple of delays due to incorrect directions provided by dispatch, which added to my overall trouble score, even though I still managed to keep everything rolling smoothly.

To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the drive, which left me feeling unsafe and incredibly stressed—my stress level was off the charts at a 9 out of 10. I can’t believe I had to deal with that and still get penalized for the late delivery. The lack of support from HR in addressing these serious issues is unacceptable, and I feel like my safety and well-being are being completely overlooked. Overall, I’d rate my trouble during this trip as an 8 out of 10, and I need HR to step up and start taking these situations seriously.|1|2024-01-08 05:16:39

First off, the directions I received were completely off, leading me to take extra time navigating through traffic and construction zones that weren’t accounted for in the route planning. It felt like I was playing a game of “guess where to go next,” which definitely added to my stress level, sitting at a solid 7.5 out of 10.

2893|128|2|1|1|I just wrapped up route 2, which took me a grueling 8.34 hours, and I need to bring some issues to your attention regarding the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was through the roof at around 8.65 out of 10, mainly due to poor communication about the load details. I didn't receive the necessary information about the delivery location until the last minute, which made it a scramble on my end. This type of disorganization makes it really hard to do my job effectively and affects my overall well-being on the road. I think we can do better in keeping drivers informed to avoid this kind of hassle in the future.|1|2024-03-09 22:20:56

2895|128|6|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 6, and I need to voice some serious frustrations about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, I can't shake off the stress I felt throughout the trip—it hit an 8.2 on my stress scale, which is pretty high for me. The lack of clear communication about the route changes and the vague instructions regarding delivery times made it tough to keep my cool. Plus, the frequent delays in getting the necessary paperwork sorted out at the pick-up point added unnecessary time to my trip, pushing my total drive to nearly 16 hours. It feels like the Operations team could do a better job of keeping us drivers informed and supported, so we're not left hanging in stressful situations.|1|2024-06-14 00:33:57
2896|128|18|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustrations with the Human Resources department following my recent trip on route 18, which took a grueling 20.34 hours and ended up being late. On top of the ridiculous amount of time spent on the road, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and my stress level skyrocketing to a painful 12.6 out of 10. I tried reaching out to HR for assistance and support, but their response was lackluster at best—no follow-up, no concern for my well-being, and it felt like I was just another number. The overall trouble score for this experience was an 8.16 out of 10, and honestly, I expected more from a company that claims to value its drivers. We deserve better support, especially in such dangerous situations.|1|2024-06-20 03:19:47

First off, my mileage reimbursement was way off; I had to go through hell to get accurate figures, and it feels like they’re just dragging their feet on processing it. Plus, the communication has been abysmal—every time I tried to reach out for clarification, I was met with vague responses or no response at all. It’s frustrating when I’m trying to do my job and get paid correctly, only to be left in the dark about my expenses. This kind of disorganization is really adding unnecessary stress to an already demanding job, and it's just not acceptable.|1|2024-06-25 05:59:26

2900|128|7|1|1|I just wrapped up route 7, which took me a grueling 13.5 hours, and I need to address some serious issues I faced with the Finance department. Despite delivering on time, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip that don't match my expectations based on the outlined rates. It's frustrating to put in the hard work and then feel like I'm not being compensated fairly, especially when I was already stressed out at a level of 8.6 out of 10 during the drive. I’ve always prided myself on reliability and punctuality, so it’s disheartening to deal with these financial hiccups after a long haul. I really need this sorted out ASAP, as it’s affecting my motivation and overall experience with the company.|1|2024-07-28 06:04:11
2901|128|18|1|1|I need to file a complaint about the Finance department because my recent route 18 was a complete nightmare, taking over 20 hours and I still missed my delivery window, which is unacceptable. On top of that, I faced a serious assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out to the max, with my stress level hitting a ridiculous 14.4 out of 10.

The lack of support and clear communication from HR has been incredibly frustrating; I've had ongoing issues with my paychecks not reflecting my hours accurately, and it feels like I'm constantly chasing down answers that should be readily available. My stress level during the trip was off the charts at 11.25/10, and it's mainly due to the uncertainty and chaos created by HR’s incompetence. It's unacceptable for someone who's been driving for six years to feel this way, and I really hope something changes before I consider my future here.|1|2024-08-01 03:33:57

Communication was a nightmare; I had no clear instructions about the load I was carrying, and it felt like I was flying blind the whole trip.

First off, the lack of communication regarding scheduling changes is incredibly frustrating; I was left in the dark about a last-minute route adjustment, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip—my stress level hit an 8.4 out of 10!

While I managed to complete my recent route in just under 7.81 hours and delivered on time, the stress I felt during the trip was off the charts—almost a 10.4 out of 10! It’s not just about the driving; it’s the lack of support and communication from HR that’s making it hard to stay motivated.

To make things worse, I faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed out of my mind—my stress level hit a whopping 15.6 out of 10. Seriously, this isn’t the first time I’ve run into issues with the Operations department, and it’s becoming a pattern that’s hard to ignore. With an overall trouble score of over 8, I’m really starting to question how we’re handling these routes.

2908|128|6|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 6, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced during the trip. First off, the communication from the Operations department was absolutely lacking—there were multiple times when I had to guess about my next stop and ended up wasting precious hours. Not to mention the vague instructions I received on some of the delivery points, which added unnecessary stress to an already long haul of over 16 hours. I get that things can get busy, but with a stress level hitting about 12/10, it's clear that the lack of clarity and support from Ops is making our jobs way harder than they need to be.

2909|128|7|1|1|I just wrapped up route 7, which took me 11.5 hours, and while I delivered on time without any issues on the road, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. They still haven’t processed my last reimbursement for fuel and tolls, and it’s been over two weeks now. This delay is causing me unnecessary stress, especially since I’ve been getting the runaround every time I reach out for an update.

It’s frustrating enough dealing with the logistics of the job without having to chase down payments that should’ve been handled by now.|1|2024-08-28 14:17:03
2910|128|18|1|1|I just wrapped up my trip on route 18, and I’ve got some serious issues to bring up with the Operations department. First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, which is frustrating enough, but what really pushed my stress level to a solid 10 was the fact that I experienced an assault during the trip.

The trip took me nearly 19 hours, and while I did manage to make the delivery on time, the stress levels were through the roof—close to a 9.5 out of 10! The main issue was the lack of proper communication regarding my loading times; I was stuck waiting for over two hours at the pick-up point because the paperwork was messed up. It felt like a total lack of organization on your end, and it really messed with my schedule. I think it's crucial for the Operations team to step up and ensure that drivers aren't left hanging and stressed out like that.|1|2024-09-20 02:25:49
2912|128|6|1|1|I just wrapped up route 6, and I really need to vent about some issues I ran into with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, which is great, the lack of communication about road closures and detours was frustrating as hell. I spent an extra hour navigating around unexpected obstacles that could've easily been avoided if someone had bothered to keep us updated. On top of that, the load I was given was poorly balanced, making the truck feel unstable at times, which definitely added a layer of stress to my trip—my stress level hit a 7.4 out of 10, and that's not ideal for anyone on the road. It feels like the Operations team needs to step up their game to make our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-09-22 23:11:38

They seem to have messed up my reimbursement for the fuel expenses and the per diem calculations don’t add up correctly. I’ve double-checked my receipts and the numbers I submitted, but it feels like I’m just getting the runaround every time I reach out for clarification.

The Operations department really dropped the ball this time—there were multiple instances of unclear instructions that made my trip unnecessarily stressful, with my stress level hitting an 8.6 out of 10. The route was full of unexpected detours and last-minute changes that weren't communicated properly, which added a lot of unnecessary pressure.

It felt like I was flying blind with no clear support when I needed it most. Plus, the truck’s maintenance issues that I reported before the trip were still not addressed, which made the whole experience even more frustrating. I’m hoping you guys can step it up next time and provide the drivers with better info and support.|1|2024-04-08 23:45:48
2922|129|46|1|1|I just wrapped up route 46, which took me a grueling 15.56 hours, and while I’m happy to report that the delivery was on time, I need to address some serious issues with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses was not processed correctly; I’m missing a chunk of what I spent out there. On top of that, the pay for this trip was lower than what was agreed upon in my contract. It's frustrating to put in long hours and not get compensated fairly, especially when the stress level was already pretty high at a 7.28 out of 10. I really need these problems sorted out because it’s affecting my motivation and trust in the company.|1|2024-04-12 09:03:23
2923|129|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and I’ve got to say, the experience was beyond frustrating. Not only was the delivery late—taking a whopping 14.36 hours—but I also encountered a serious issue when I was assaulted during the trip, which cranked my stress level up to a staggering 13.29 out of 10. To top it off, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.19, and that’s just unacceptable. I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball on this one. We need better support and communication to ensure that drivers like me aren’t left high and dry in dangerous situations.|1|2024-04-15 11:35:23
2924|129|47|1|1|I just wrapped up route 47, which took an exhausting 19.67 hours, and I’ve got to say, I’m seriously frustrated with the Finance department. Not only was my delivery late, but I dealt with a ton of unnecessary stress throughout the whole trip, scoring a solid 10.73 on my stress scale. To top it off, my compensation still hasn't been processed correctly, which is just adding insult to injury after the trouble I went through. I really think the Finance team needs to get their act together and sort out these payment issues ASAP because it's making my job way harder than it needs to be.|1|2024-04-21 23:44:51
2925|129|11|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 11, which took me over 15.5 hours to finish. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication and support from HR during the trip really added to my stress, which I’d rate at about an 8.4 out of 10. I felt like there was no one to turn to for help when issues arose, and it seemed like HR was completely disconnected from the realities of our work on the road. This lack of responsiveness made a tough job even harder and left me feeling undervalued as a driver. I think it’s high time HR stepped up their game and provided better support for us out here.|1|2024-04-24 20:20:14
2926|129|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and I need to vent about some serious issues I’ve been having with the HR department. While I managed to deliver on time after a grueling 20 hours on the road, the stress level was definitely higher than it should have been, hitting around 7.7 out of 10, thanks in part to the lack of support and communication from HR. I’ve been trying to reach out regarding some benefits and payroll discrepancies, but it feels like I’m just hitting a brick wall. The overall trouble score was low at 1.8, but the frustration with HR is really dragging me down. I think it’s high time they step up their game and actually listen to the drivers who keep this company rolling!|1|2024-04-27 07:04:18
2927|129|11|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustrations with the Finance department after completing route 11, which took me over 15 hours and ended up being late. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of a long haul, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and further contributed to my high stress level of over 11 out of 10. To make matters worse, the financial discrepancies from this trip have been a nightmare to sort out—missing reimbursements and unclear deductions that are making it even harder to focus on my job.

2928|129|18|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 18, which took me about 17.4 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, I encountered several issues with the reimbursement process for my expenses. It’s been a hassle trying to get my mileage and fuel costs sorted out—there seems to be a lack of clarity in the forms and how they’re processed, leading to delays that really add to my stress. I mean, my stress level was already at a 10.4 during the trip, and dealing with Finance shouldn’t be adding to that. The overall trouble score may seem low at 2.5, but these repetitive issues are starting to wear me down. I’d appreciate it if someone could look into this and streamline the process, so drivers like me don’t have to chase after our own money.|1|2024-06-09 20:45:39

It feels like I’m chasing my own money here, and honestly, it’s wearing me down. I expect better communication and a more efficient process from Finance because this is seriously impacting my morale and motivation.|1|2024-06-13 08:46:17
2930|129|47|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent experience after completing route 47. While I managed to deliver on time and the trip went relatively smoothly, I encountered several issues with the reimbursement process for my expenses. It’s been a headache trying to get my fuel and toll costs covered, as there's been a delay in processing and lack of communication from the finance team. I feel like I'm being left in the dark with no updates, and it’s adding unnecessary stress to my job. I’ve been driving for five years, and this is the first time I’ve had such a tough time getting reimbursed. It’s really making me reconsider how things are being handled on that front.|1|2024-06-14 18:09:43
2931|129|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and I can't hold back my frustration any longer. The whole trip took nearly 18 hours, which is far from the schedule we were given, and to top it off, I experienced an assault during the delivery. This kind of situation is unacceptable and makes an already stressful job feel unbearable—my stress level was through the roof at an 11 out of 10. The Operations department really needs to do a better job of planning routes and ensuring driver safety. I’m tired of feeling like I’m putting my life at risk while trying to do my job, and honestly, the overall trouble score for this route was an 8 out of 10, which is just ridiculous. We need some serious changes to avoid these kinds of issues in the future.|1|2024-06-30 06:08:27
2932|129|46|1|1|Hey there, I just wrapped up route 46, which took me a grueling 15.6 hours, and I’ve gotta say I’m pretty frustrated with the Human Resources department. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof, scoring a 9.9 out of 10, mostly due to the lack of communication and support from HR when I reached out for help with some route-related issues.

I’ve been driving for five years now, and I expected a bit more assistance and responsiveness from HR, especially when I’m out there on the road putting in the hours.

2933|129|46|1|1|I want to express my frustration with the Finance department after my recent trip on Route 46, which took me nearly 18.38 hours to complete, but thankfully, I made the delivery on time. Despite my successful delivery, I’ve been dealing with some serious discrepancies regarding my pay that haven’t been resolved. I noticed that my compensation doesn’t reflect the extra hours I put in and there’s been no clear communication or explanation regarding the deductions that seem off. It’s really stressful when you’re out there on the road, trying to do your job right, and then you come back to this kind of headache. I expect better from the Finance team, especially when I’m out here giving it my all.|1|2024-07-03 10:50:14
2934|129|11|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 11, and honestly, I’m beyond frustrated with how things went down.

To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the route that left me shaken and stressed to the max, my stress level hitting around 14.4 out of 10. I mean, come on, this isn’t just about delays; it’s about safety and support, which I felt was seriously lacking from the Operations department. My overall trouble score for this trip is an 8.2, and I think it’s high time someone steps up and addresses these major issues!|1|2024-07-04 17:22:50
2935|129|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and I've got to say, the Operations department really needs to get their act together. While I managed to deliver on time, the trip took an exhausting 18.28 hours, and the stress level was through the roof—about 12.6 out of 10! It felt like I was navigating a maze with no support; the routing was off, causing unnecessary delays, and the communication from Ops was practically non-existent when I needed updates. I get that we all have our off days, but this level of disorganization is just unacceptable and puts way too much pressure on us drivers. I’d appreciate a serious look into these issues before they lead to bigger problems down the road.|1|2024-07-07 12:18:56
2936|129|47|1|1|I just wrapped up route 47, and I need to vent about some serious issues I encountered with the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the entire trip took an exhausting 14.75 hours, and the stress level was through the roof at a solid 9.5 out of 10. The communication from Operations was pretty much non-existent; I had no idea about road closures or detours until I was right on top of them, which added unnecessary chaos to my route. Plus, the load I was given was poorly balanced, making the truck hard to handle and adding to my stress. With an overall trouble score of 0.74, it’s clear that there are fundamental problems that need fixing, and I'm really hoping someone steps up to address these issues before the next driver has to deal with them.|1|2024-07-11 12:19:20

While my delivery was on time and I didn’t face any serious issues, the level of stress I experienced was pretty high—around an 8.5 out of 10—which I largely attribute to the lack of support and communication from HR regarding recent policy changes. It seems like there’s been a disconnect between management and drivers, leaving us in the dark about critical info that directly impacts our jobs and well-being. It's frustrating when we’re out here doing our best on the road, only to feel unsupported by the folks who are supposed to have our backs.|1|2024-07-13 13:08:55

While I managed to deliver on time, I felt overwhelmed with the stress level hitting a 7 out of 10 due to unclear expectations and insufficient resources provided for this trip.

The overall trouble score for this trip was an alarming 8.08, and I feel like the Operations department really dropped the ball in terms of support and safety.

The per diem isn’t reflecting the hours I worked, and it seems like there are some deductions that I can't even figure out.

First off, the lack of communication regarding our schedules has been a real pain; I was left in the dark about some last-minute changes that could have been handled better. Also, the support for drivers dealing with stress is practically non-existent—my stress level hit a solid 7.83 during this trip, and it feels like HR doesn’t care about our mental well-being. It’s disappointing that after five years in this job, I’m still facing issues that should have been addressed ages ago. Can we get some real support and communication sorted out?|1|2024-07-29 11:09:59
2942|129|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, and while I got the delivery done on time, I had a pretty rough go with the Operations department that I need to bring up. First off, the route guidance was all over the place—some of the directions didn't match up with the GPS, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip that clocked in at over 16 hours. Plus, I had to deal with some delays at the last-minute stop due to miscommunication about unloading times, which just piled on the frustration. I’m all for keeping things moving smoothly, but these issues made it harder than it needed to be.

Plus, the lack of clear instructions on the loading dock caused delays that ate into my driving hours. It’s frustrating because I take my job seriously, and this kind of disorganization makes it so much harder to do it well.

First off, the reimbursement for my fuel expenses was lower than what I actually spent, and it seems like they didn’t account for the extra tolls I had to pay on the route. I’ve tried reaching out for clarification but haven’t gotten any response, which is frustrating. Plus, the paperwork for my trip was a mess—missing signatures and incorrect mileage that just added to my stress during the drive, which was already sitting at a solid 7.3/10.

Plus, the route directions were a mess; I ended up taking longer than I should have due to incorrect waypoints that wasted precious hours.

There were multiple points during the trip where I had to guess about loading times and rest breaks because I never received the updated info I needed. It’s like they don’t realize how crucial timely information is for us on the road. I’m all for getting the job done, but this kind of disorganization makes it really tough and affects our performance. Can we please work on improving communication?|1|2024-11-27 04:28:29

First off, I encountered an assault during the trip that put me on edge and understandably raised my stress level to an unbearable 10.9 out of 10. The lack of support from the Human Resources department in dealing with this matter has been incredibly disappointing; I felt completely alone and unsafe.

While the delivery was on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof, sitting at a 9.45 out of 10. This is largely due to the lack of accurate routing information and the poor communication I received regarding load details.

It's hard to maintain a good mindset when I’m left in the dark about changes or issues that directly impact my route.

2962|129|18|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 18, which took a whopping 18.8 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was way more stressful than it needed to be, rating an 8.5 out of 10 on the stress scale. The real issue was the lack of communication regarding traffic delays and the last-minute changes to my drop-off location, which threw me off my game. I also found the load management on this route to be poorly organized, making it harder to handle everything smoothly. It's disappointing because I’ve put in my time and effort, and I feel like the Operations team could do a better job supporting drivers like me out on the road.|1|2025-01-24 07:28:26

It was a real headache trying to get my reimbursement sorted out for the fuel costs – the numbers they initially provided were way off, and it took way too long to get a response. I shouldn't have to spend so much time chasing down a simple reimbursement when I'm already dealing with the stress of long hours and tight schedules. Can we please get this sorted out properly so drivers like me don’t have to deal with these unnecessary hassles?|1|2024-04-01 13:52:45

The Operations department really dropped the ball this time. First off, the route they gave me was filled with unexpected detours that added unnecessary time to my trip, which is not what I need when I'm already dealing with the stress of the road—my stress level was through the roof at an 8.2! Plus, there was zero communication about a couple of road closures that I hit, and I had to scramble to figure out alternative ways to get to my destination. For someone with six years of experience, this kind of oversight is just unacceptable and it made the whole trip a lot more stressful than it needed to be.|1|2024-05-30 22:41:59

I’ve reached out multiple times about these issues, but it feels like I’m hitting a brick wall.

It’s been over two weeks, and the lack of communication and clarity from their end has only added to my stress, which was already pretty high at an 8.87 during the trip.

3003|132|6|1|1|I just finished route 6, and I’ve got to say, I'm really frustrated with how things went down. The trip took me over 14 hours, and not only did I miss my delivery window, but I also faced some serious issues with the Operations department that left me feeling unsafe and stressed out of my mind—my stress level hit a solid 10. I even experienced an assault during the trip, which is completely unacceptable and should have been addressed way beforehand. Overall, the trouble with the route was an 8 out of 10, and I can’t help but feel like this could have been avoided with better planning and support from Operations. It’s high time we start prioritizing our safety and efficiency on the road!|1|2024-10-07 18:40:33

While my delivery was on time and I didn’t face any major issues during the trip, I’ve been dealing with a lot of confusion around my pay for this load. The numbers just don’t add up, and it’s really stressing me out—my stress level hit nearly a 9! I’ve tried reaching out for clarification, but the responses have been slow and unclear, leaving me feeling like I’m chasing my own paycheck. It’s frustrating to put in the hours only to feel like I’m not being compensated correctly. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-10-10 03:21:57
3005|132|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, which took nearly 18 hours, and I gotta say, the whole experience was a bit of a mess thanks to the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the lack of clear communication about the loading times and the constant changes to my scheduled stops really ramped up my stress level—I'm sitting at a solid 7 out of 10 for that trip! Plus, I encountered some serious inefficiencies at the last drop-off point that wasted my time and didn't seem to consider my tight schedule. It feels like the Ops team isn’t fully aligned with the realities on the road, and that needs to change if we want to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-10-11 00:27:58
3006|132|6|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department following my recent trip on route 6, which took an exhausting 14.5 hours and didn't even end up on time. On top of that, I had a serious incident where I was assaulted during the delivery—something that’s absolutely unacceptable and should never happen to any driver. The stress I felt was off the charts, sitting at a level of 10.3 out of 10, and the overall trouble I experienced throughout this trip was an 8.1 out of 10. It's incredibly disheartening that HR hasn’t been proactive in addressing safety concerns or supporting drivers like me, who are out here facing these challenges every day.

Not only did this incident affect my ability to focus and perform my job, but it also made me question the support and resources available for drivers in these situations. With an overall trouble score of 8.8, I expected HR to be more proactive in providing assistance and ensuring our safety, but it seems like that’s just not happening. I really hope we can address these issues moving forward because it’s incredibly disheartening to feel this way while just trying to do my job.|1|2025-01-01 10:53:06
3008|132|3|1|1|I just wrapped up route 3, and I really need to vent about some issues I've had with the Finance department. Even though I made the delivery on time after an exhausting 8.46-hour trip, my stress levels were through the roof at nearly 12/10 due to the constant delays in receiving my reimbursement for expenses. It’s frustrating to chase after payments and not get clear answers, especially when my overall trouble score was barely a 1/10. I’ve put in my time and effort, and it's disheartening to feel undervalued when it comes to getting compensated for my hard work. Can we please get some better communication and efficiency in the Finance department?|1|2025-01-04 18:14:17
3009|132|1|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 1, and I need to vent about some issues I faced with the Operations department. First off, the load was misrouted, which added unnecessary stress and made the trip way more complicated than it needed to be; I spent 11.6 hours on the road, and while I delivered on time, the constant uncertainty about my route had my stress level shooting up to nearly a 9.3 out of 10. Plus, the lack of communication about the delivery specifics really threw me off—there were times I felt completely in the dark about what was expected at the drop-off. Overall, my trouble score was just shy of a 1, but honestly, it felt much worse on the road. Can we please get some better coordination moving forward?

3010|132|1|1|1|I just wrapped up route 1, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the entire experience was riddled with issues that made it unnecessarily stressful, scoring a solid 7.5 on my stress scale. For starters, the navigation instructions were outdated and led me to a couple of wrong turns, wasting valuable time and adding to my overall trouble score of almost 1. During the trip, I also noticed that the load was improperly secured, which made the driving experience nerve-wracking at times. It's disappointing to see these avoidable issues happening when we’re all working hard to keep things running smoothly. We need better communication and updates from the Ops team to ensure our safety and efficiency on the road.|1|2025-01-07 02:13:22

While I managed to hit the delivery deadline, the stress level was through the roof at a solid 9.5 out of 10. I encountered several issues with the routing instructions that were unclear and not updated, which added unnecessary time and anxiety to my trip. Plus, the lack of communication regarding fueling stops left me scrambling to find a station when I was running low.

I hit some unexpected detours that weren’t flagged in advance, causing delays and unnecessary tension.

It seems like every time I reach out for clarification, I get the runaround or no response at all.

First off, the load information was inconsistent, which led to confusion at my drop-off point and caused unnecessary delays despite my best efforts to stay on schedule. I also found the communication to be lacking; I reached out for clarification on a couple of points during the trip, and it took too long to get a response, which only added to my stress level, sitting at around 7.9 out of 10. When you’re on the road for over 30 hours, dealing with these avoidable headaches makes a tough job even tougher.

There’s been a mix-up with my mileage reimbursement; it’s way lower than what I actually drove, and I can't seem to get anyone to sort it out.

While I managed to deliver on time, the constant lack of communication about my load and the vague routing info drove my stress level through the roof, sitting at about 9.5 out of 10. I wasted way too much time trying to figure out where I was supposed to be and dealing with unexpected detours that weren’t mentioned beforehand.

I’m not sure if someone dropped the ball on processing or if there’s a glitch in the system, but it’s making my life harder. On top of that, my pay for this trip was short, and it's a real pain to chase down the discrepancies when I should be focused on driving.

Plus, I had issues with the loading process at the warehouse that wasted a good chunk of my time and resulted in a lack of communication from dispatch when I needed updates. It's frustrating to deal with that kind of disorganization, especially when we’re out there trying to do our jobs efficiently.|1|2024-11-17 17:14:14

I also had to deal with outdated directions that sent me on a wild goose chase, wasting precious hours and nearly pushing me over the edge.

First off, the communication from the Operations department was all over the place; I was left hanging for hours without any updates on my next load, which really ramped up my stress level to a solid 8.9 out of 10. Plus, the route they assigned me had several unexpected detours due to road construction, and it felt like nobody bothered to give us a heads-up.

While I did complete route 20 on time, the stress level during the trip was higher than it should have been, primarily due to the lack of communication and support from HR when it comes to addressing driver concerns. I’ve raised questions about scheduling and workload stress before, but I feel like they’ve fallen on deaf ears.

To top it off, I encountered an assault during the delivery, which left me feeling completely unsafe and stressed out—my stress level was through the roof at 11 out of 10! It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a dangerous situation without proper support or communication from HR. Overall, my trouble score for this trip was an 8.1, and I can’t help but feel like the lack of attention to driver safety and well-being is a huge oversight.

On top of that, I had to deal with an assault that really shook me up, pushing my stress level to a whopping 9 out of 10. I can't help but feel that the Finance team isn’t giving us the support we need, especially when it comes to addressing delays and ensuring our safety on the road.

3086|136|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and while I managed to deliver on time after nearly 19 hours on the road, I have to say I’m really frustrated with the Finance department. It seems like every time I submit my expenses, there are delays and unnecessary complications that make it a real headache. I’ve had to chase down invoices and clarify things that should be straightforward, which just adds to my stress during an already long trip. I’m not asking for much, just a smoother process so I can focus on driving instead of dealing with paperwork that feels like it’s stuck in the stone age. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-01-26 15:46:55

Not only did I miss my delivery time, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me shaken and stressed, rating my stress level at a solid 9.56 out of 10. On top of that, the overall trouble I encountered was an 8.06, and it feels like the Finance department isn't doing anything to support drivers like me who are out here risking our safety and livelihoods. We need better communication and resources to handle these kinds of situations, or else it’s just going to keep getting worse.|1|2024-02-22 22:21:32
3088|136|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, and I've got to say, the whole experience was pretty frustrating. First off, my delivery was late, which is never a good look for us drivers, especially when I put in 18 hours on the road! The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one, as there were unclear directions and last-minute changes that left me stressed out with a level 8 out of 10. It felt like I was constantly scrambling to figure things out, and with an overall trouble score of just 1.5, it shouldn't have been that complicated. I really think the Ops team needs to get their act together to avoid these kinds of hiccups in the future.|1|2024-02-24 04:08:09
3089|136|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, and I've got to say, this trip was a nightmare. It took me over 9 hours to complete, way longer than it should have, and on top of that, I didn’t even make the delivery on time. The stress level was through the roof—definitely a solid 9.9 out of 10—especially after facing an assault during the drive. I can't believe the Operations department didn’t provide adequate support or communication about the route issues, and it’s beyond frustrating to finish a job feeling unsafe and overworked. I really think it's time for some serious changes; this isn’t just about metrics, it's about our well-being and safety on the road.|1|2024-05-06 09:29:58
3090|136|10|1|1|Hey, I just wrapped up route 10, and I’ve got to voice some concerns about the Operations department. While I did manage to deliver on time, the whole trip took a grueling 13.2 hours, and it felt like I was constantly battling against poor communication and inadequate support from the office. I had multiple times where I needed clarification about my next stops, but it took way too long to get any response, which just added to my stress level—sitting at an 8 out of 10. The overall trouble score might not seem too bad, but the lack of timely updates and assistance really made this trip unnecessarily frustrating. I think we need to get better systems in place to help drivers out on the road.|1|2024-05-08 22:26:33
3091|136|33|1|1|I need to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding my recent trip on route 33, which took an exhausting 28.19 hours—way longer than it should have. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an assault during the trip that left me on edge, bumping my stress level up to a staggering 9.48 out of 10. It feels like the financial side of things doesn't take into account the added risks and challenges we face out on the road.

I hope you can address these issues before they escalate further.|1|2024-07-31 20:14:49
3092|136|33|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 33, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I delivered on time, the whole trip felt like a rollercoaster of stress—my stress level hit nearly 9 out of 10! From the get-go, I faced issues with the load not being properly secured, which had me on edge the whole time, worrying about safety on the road. Additionally, communication was a mess; I couldn't get any clear updates regarding potential road closures, which made planning my stops a nightmare. It's frustrating to deal with these avoidable problems when I'm just trying to do my job right. We really need to step it up in Operations to avoid these headaches in the future!|1|2024-08-03 14:06:54
3093|136|32|1|1|I just wrapped up route 32, and I have to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to complete the delivery on time, the whole experience was unnecessarily stressful and could have been handled better. The paperwork was a mess, with incorrect addresses and missing contact info, which added hours to my trip and made communication with the receiver a nightmare. On top of that, my routing was off, leading me through some questionable back roads that were not only time-consuming but also nerve-wracking. I’ve been driving for 8 years now, and I expect better organization and support, especially when I’m out there for over 14 hours. We need to get this sorted out to make our jobs easier and safer.|1|2024-08-05 17:48:50

There needs to be better support and safety measures for drivers out there; we can't be put in these dangerous situations without proper backup!|1|2024-09-15 18:29:49
3095|136|33|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 33, which took me nearly 28 hours, and I need to vent a bit about some serious issues I faced with the Operations department. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the stress throughout the trip was off the charts—like a 9.2 out of 10! The lack of clear communication about my stops and the constant changes to the route really threw me off, making it tough to stick to my schedule and keep my cool. Plus, I was dealing with tight deadlines and conflicting instructions that felt like a recipe for disaster. It’s frustrating to work under such conditions when we’re all just trying to do our jobs efficiently. Let’s get this sorted out, because it’s affecting not just me, but the whole team.|1|2024-09-17 22:32:16
3096|136|27|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 27, which took an exhausting 13.9 hours, and let me just say, it was a nightmare. Not only was the delivery late, but I also had to deal with an assault during the trip that left me shaken and on edge – my stress level was through the roof at a 9.5/10. On top of that, I’m still waiting for the reimbursement for the expenses I incurred, and the lack of communication from Finance is unacceptable. Honestly, with an overall trouble score of 8.03/10, it feels like no one in the department cares about the well-being of drivers like me.

3097|136|41|1|1|I just wrapped up route 41, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. The load I was given was not only poorly documented, but the route directions were outdated, leading to unnecessary detours that added to my stress level—I'd rate it a solid 7.9 out of 10 on the stress scale. It felt like I was driving blind at times, and I can't help but think that better planning on your part could have made this trip a lot smoother. The overall trouble score was low at 1.3, but the headaches I experienced along the way were completely avoidable if the Operations team had done their job right.|1|2024-10-09 04:23:08
3098|136|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. First off, the delivery was late—14.41 hours on the clock and still no on-time drop-off, which is just unacceptable. To make matters worse, I encountered an aggressive situation that felt like an assault while I was on the road, which skyrocketed my stress level to a near 10. I’ve been driving for eight years, and I’ve never felt this unsafe or overwhelmed on a trip. With an overall trouble score of 8.03 out of 10, it’s clear that something needs to change. This kind of experience is not just a hiccup; it’s a serious concern that needs immediate attention.|1|2024-12-30 12:07:49
3099|136|24|1|1|I just wrapped up route 24, which took me a grueling 15.32 hours, and I’ve got to say, I'm pretty frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the lack of communication from dispatch was a real pain—there were several points during the trip where I had no idea about upcoming detours or delays, which ramped my stress level up to an 8.16. Not to mention, the load was improperly secured, causing me to constantly worry about potential damage or safety hazards. I feel like with my 8 years on the road, I shouldn’t have to deal with these avoidable issues. Overall, my trouble score was only 1.49, but that’s mainly because I’m used to navigating chaos; it shouldn’t be this way in the first place. |1|2024-12-31 19:00:48
3100|136|41|1|1|I'm writing to express my serious concerns regarding the handling of my recent trip on route 41, which took over 4.28 hours and, unfortunately, was not delivered on time. The stress level during this trip was off the charts, hitting an 11.66 out of 10, largely due to an assault I experienced on the road that left me feeling unsafe and unsupported. It’s frustrating to feel like Human Resources has dropped the ball when it comes to addressing safety and support for drivers like me. The overall trouble score I encountered was an 8.03 out of 10, and I believe it's high time that HR takes these issues seriously and provides us with the help and resources we need to do our jobs safely and effectively.|1|2025-01-06 16:52:10
3101|136|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and I need to voice my frustration with the Operations department. Despite the delivery being on time, the entire trip took a whopping 29.3 hours, and I felt like I was constantly battling against the clock with zero support. The communication from the Ops team was practically non-existent; I had to deal with unexpected detours that weren’t communicated ahead of time, which ramped up my stress level to a solid 10.5 out of 10. I get that logistics can be tricky, but this lack of coordination and support is unacceptable for someone who's been in the game for 8 years.

3102|136|10|1|1|I just wrapped up Route 10, and while I got the delivery done on time, I have to voice my frustrations with the Operations department. The communication leading up to this trip was a total mess; I didn’t receive proper updates on the loading schedule, which had me sitting around for way too long before I could hit the road. This added unnecessary stress to my journey, bringing my stress level up to nearly an 8 out of 10. On top of that, the route they had me take was poorly planned, with construction and detours that weren't mentioned beforehand, making the drive longer than it needed to be—clocking in at nearly 11 hours.

3104|136|24|1|1|I’m reaching out to express my frustration with the Finance department regarding the compensation for my recent route 24 trip, which took me 11.43 hours. While I completed the delivery on time and my overall trouble score was relatively low, I noticed discrepancies in the pay calculation that don't match the hours I actually worked. It's really disappointing to see my hard work not reflected accurately in my paycheck. I’ve been driving for eight years, and I expect better communication and accuracy from Finance, especially when it comes to ensuring that drivers are compensated fairly for their time and effort.|1|2025-04-29 00:13:05
3105|136|32|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing route 32, which took me nearly 14 and a half hours and was anything but smooth. First off, the delivery was late, and that’s not what I signed up for. To add insult to injury, I actually encountered an assault during the trip, which made an already stressful situation way worse—my stress level was off the charts at a 9.8 out of 10! With an overall trouble score of over 8, it’s clear that the Operations department needs to step up their game and ensure that drivers are not put in harm's way and that routes are better planned to avoid these ridiculous delays.

On top of the stress from the delays, I unfortunately experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to a staggering 9.43 out of 10. To make matters worse, the financial compensation for this ordeal doesn’t seem to reflect the trouble I went through—my overall trouble score was an 8.05, and I feel like the Finance department isn’t taking our safety and well-being seriously.

3107|137|6|1|1|I just wrapped up route 6, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say the experience was pretty frustrating. The Operations department really dropped the ball on a couple of things. First off, the route they assigned me was unnecessarily convoluted, which added extra time and stress to the trip—my stress level was around an 8 out of 10 by the end. I also had issues with the load; it wasn't properly secured, which made for a nerve-wracking drive. I get that things can get hectic, but better planning and communication from Operations could have made this trip a lot smoother.|1|2024-01-10 22:35:46
3108|137|6|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 6 delivery, which took an exhausting 14.63 hours and was not delivered on time.

The overall trouble score for this route was an 8.07, and honestly, it felt like the company didn’t have my back when I needed support the most.

The route planning felt completely off, with way too many unnecessary stops and confusing directions that added to my stress, which was already sitting at an 8.4 out of 10.

First off, my reimbursement for fuel and tolls was short, and it’s getting really frustrating trying to chase down those missing funds. I shouldn't have to spend my precious time digging through paperwork to get what's owed to me. Plus, the communication from Finance has been downright lacking—no one seems to know what’s going on, and I’m left hanging with no answers. It’s totally adding to my stress level, which was already pretty high during the trip, and it’s just not cool.|1|2024-05-31 08:36:06

Even though I delivered on time, the entire trip was a nightmare—my stress levels were through the roof, hitting an 11.3 out of 10.

While I managed to complete route 6 on time, the stress level during the trip was a solid 8 out of 10, largely due to lack of communication and support. I’ve noticed a consistent lack of responsiveness from HR when it comes to addressing our concerns about scheduling and workload management, which feels like they’re not taking us seriously. It’s disheartening to feel like our well-being isn’t prioritized, especially when we're out there for over 15 hours on the road, and I think it’s time for HR to step up and actually listen to what we, the drivers, have to say.|1|2024-11-11 19:56:09

First off, the lack of communication from HR has been a constant source of frustration; I’ve been trying to get clarity on my benefits and training opportunities, but every time I reach out, it feels like I’m talking to a wall. This lack of support only adds to my stress level, which hit an 11 during this trip! Plus, the overall disconnect in addressing driver concerns is alarming; we're out here on the road working hard, and it feels like HR doesn’t have our backs.

First off, the level of stress I faced on this trip was through the roof, scoring a solid 10.5 out of 10, and to make things worse, I was assaulted during my run, which left me feeling vulnerable and unsupported. Despite being a driver with 6 years of experience, I felt completely let down by HR’s lack of communication and support in addressing these serious issues. The overall trouble score of 8.07 reflects just how many problems I encountered, and it's unacceptable that I had to deal with this alone without any help from the HR team.

While I managed to complete the trip on time—clocking in at 13.71 hours—there were several issues that really added unnecessary stress to my journey, which I rated an 8 out of 10. For starters, the route planning seemed off; I hit some unexpected road closures that weren't communicated ahead of time, forcing me to take a longer detour.

This could have easily been avoided with better communication and updated routing information. Additionally, I faced some delays at the delivery site due to a lack of coordination on their end, which really upped my stress level.

On top of that, the lack of support and communication from HR about safety protocols and how to handle such incidents is disappointing and unacceptable. With an overall trouble score of 8.16, I expected better from a company that claims to value its drivers. It’s high time HR stepped up and addressed these serious issues.|1|2024-04-22 08:43:54
3165|140|34|1|1|I just wrapped up route 34, which took nearly 24.5 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, the experience was anything but smooth, largely due to the lack of support from HR. I'm feeling pretty frustrated because I reached out for help regarding some scheduling issues and never got a response, which only added to my stress—let's just say my stress level was through the roof at a solid 10.37 out of 10. It feels like HR is completely disconnected from the realities we face on the road, and when you’re juggling tight schedules and long hours, the last thing you need is to feel ignored. I hope this feedback helps improve things for the next driver.|1|2024-04-25 04:29:20
3166|140|18|1|1|I just wrapped up route 18, which took me nearly 23 hours, and while the delivery went smoothly and on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my reimbursement for fuel expenses is still pending, and it’s been over a week since I submitted the receipts. On top of that, I noticed some discrepancies in my last paycheck that just don’t add up; I’m missing a couple of hours that I know I worked. This has been super frustrating, especially with the stress of the trip already weighing on me at nearly a 9 out of 10. I really need these issues sorted out ASAP so I can focus on driving rather than worrying about my pay.|1|2024-04-26 15:31:40

It’s frustrating to have to chase this down when I’m already dealing with the stress of long hours behind the wheel—my stress level hit an 11 out of 10 on this trip!

To top it all off, the lack of support from Finance when I tried to discuss my delayed payments has been incredibly disheartening, giving me an overall trouble score of 8.16.

The trip took almost 23 hours, and I encountered multiple issues that could've been easily avoided with better planning. For starters, the GPS directions sent me on a detour that added an extra hour to my haul, not to mention the lack of communication regarding the truck's maintenance schedule has me worried about breakdowns on the road. I also felt pretty stressed throughout the trip, with a stress level around 8 out of 10, mainly due to the uncertainty of whether I’d make it on time.

I encountered several issues with the load assignments that led to unnecessary delays—first, there were discrepancies with the paperwork that made me waste about an hour at the pickup point, and then the GPS directions sent me on a wild goose chase through back roads that added to the travel time. My stress level was already at a 7.3, and honestly, it shouldn't be this hard to get from point A to B without all these hiccups. Overall, it felt like a 2.2 trouble score should have been way better if the Operations team had just done their job right.|1|2024-03-16 14:15:26

It took me nearly 19.4 hours to complete, and not only was the delivery late, but I also faced an alarming situation where I was assaulted during the journey. The stress level was off the charts—I'd say a solid 13.5 out of 10—and the overall trouble I encountered was an 8.2 out of 10. The Operations department needs to seriously reevaluate their planning and support, as this experience was not only frustrating but also dangerous. It feels like there’s a lack of attention to driver safety and proper scheduling, and I can’t help but feel that this needs urgent improvement.|1|2024-03-27 11:28:45

Despite delivering on time after a grueling 11.1-hour drive, I’m still waiting on my compensation, and the lack of communication is driving me up the wall. I’ve reached out multiple times for clarity on my pay and expenses, but it's like talking to a brick wall. With my stress level hitting a 10.4 during the trip, the last thing I need is this added headache. It’s making it hard to focus on driving when I’m stressing about whether I’ll even get paid correctly for my hard work. Can someone please get this sorted out?|1|2024-04-07 03:59:37

First off, I noticed discrepancies in my pay for this trip; the hours I clocked don't match what I was compensated for, and it’s frustrating to put in that much effort only to feel shortchanged. On top of that, there’s been zero communication from Finance regarding these issues—I’ve tried reaching out multiple times with no response.

Communication has been a mess lately; I’ve been trying to get clarity on my benefits and some recent policy changes, but every time I reach out, I either get vague answers or no response at all. It’s really adding to my stress, which was already at a 7 out of 10 during this trip. I know I'm not alone in feeling neglected, and it’s just not cool when we’re out here working hard and trying to keep things running smoothly.|1|2024-04-10 20:14:44

This isn't just about me; it affects everyone on the team, and I really think we need to have a serious conversation about how HR is handling these matters.|1|2024-09-20 08:10:27
3245|142|11|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing Route 11, which took me a grueling 14 hours. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole experience was marred by a lack of communication regarding traffic conditions and unexpected detours that were not relayed to me in advance. This led to unnecessary stress, pushing my stress level to a 7.3 out of 10, and the overall trouble I faced during the trip was still a concerning 0.75. It feels like there’s a disconnect between what the Operations team knows and what drivers like me actually need to do our jobs effectively. Better communication would go a long way in making our lives easier and ensuring smoother deliveries.|1|2024-09-24 06:26:26
3246|142|28|1|1|I’m writing to formally express my frustration with the Human Resources department regarding my recent experience on route 28. First off, I want to bring to your attention that my delivery was late, which is not just a minor inconvenience but a serious issue that affects our clients and the company's reputation. On top of that, I endured a distressing incident where I was assaulted during the trip. This led to an overwhelming stress level of over 10 out of 10, and it’s unacceptable that I had to go through that without proper support from HR. Overall, my trouble score was an alarming 8.07, and I believe it’s crucial for HR to address these serious safety and operational issues to prevent them from happening again.|1|2024-10-03 09:40:04
3247|142|11|1|1|I just wrapped up route 11, and I've got to say, the Operations department really needs to get their act together. While I managed to deliver on time, the whole trip was a nightmare due to the lack of proper communication regarding the load and frequent changes in route directions that weren't updated in the system. I spent nearly 18.5 hours on the road, and the stress level was through the roof at 8.7 out of 10! It felt like I was driving blind half the time, which is unacceptable. I don't want to be dealing with this kind of chaos on my runs, especially when I’m trying to keep the schedule and my sanity intact.|1|2024-10-06 23:44:09

To add to the stress, I experienced an assault during the trip, which pushed my stress level to an unbearable 14.5 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from Operations only made things worse, contributing to an overall trouble score of 8.1. I feel like I was left to handle a dangerous situation alone, and it’s unacceptable that drivers like me have to put up with this kind of treatment. We deserve better support and safety measures in place.|1|2024-10-08 00:00:05
3249|142|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, and I need to vent about some serious issues I encountered with the Operations department. While I was able to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof at an 11.33 out of 10. The route was poorly planned, causing unnecessary delays and confusion at multiple stops. I also faced equipment issues that weren't communicated beforehand, which made for a frustrating experience on the road. I get that things can get hectic, but we need better coordination and support to ensure drivers aren’t left scrambling like this. It's exhausting, and it feels like the Operations team isn't really in tune with what we're dealing with out there.|1|2024-10-09 07:00:49
3250|142|25|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 25, which, while I delivered on time and didn’t experience any serious issues, was marred by some serious miscommunication and lack of support from HR. I’ve been a driver for six years, and during this trip that took nearly 9.8 hours, I tried to reach out for clarification on some new policies that seemed to change overnight, but I couldn’t get anyone on the line to help me out. This left me feeling stressed out, with a stress level of 8.2/10, and it’s not the first time this has happened. I really think HR needs to step up their game and provide better support for drivers like me who are out there working hard and trying to follow the rules.|1|2024-10-10 21:53:15

Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced a distressing situation when I was assaulted during the trip, which skyrocketed my stress level to a near-breaking point of 9.8 out of 10. The continuous lack of support and effective communication from the Operations team has made this job feel increasingly unsafe and stressful, with an overall trouble score of 8.1.

3252|142|25|1|1|I just wrapped up route 25, and I've got to say, I'm pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The trip took me over 11 hours, and not only was I late on the delivery, but the whole experience felt disorganized. I ran into unexpected road closures that weren’t communicated to me until I was already on the road, which added unnecessary stress to an already long haul—my stress level clocked in around an 8 out of 10. Plus, the lack of updated routing info made me feel like I was driving blind out there. It’s disappointing because I’ve been doing this for six years, and I expect better support from our team. I hope you can address these issues so we can all do our jobs more effectively and without the added headache.|1|2024-11-28 09:41:39

I expect better from the company, and it’s high time we address these issues head-on.|1|2024-12-16 20:57:18
3254|142|25|1|1|I just wrapped up route 25, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Finance department. First off, my pay for this trip was short, and it’s frustrating because I put in 9.21 hours of hard work. I can't understand why my compensation doesn’t reflect the effort and time I put in; it’s not like I’m asking for a handout here, just what I’ve earned. Plus, trying to get in touch with someone from Finance was a nightmare—they were either unresponsive or gave me the runaround. My stress level hit an 8.1 during the trip because of this, and it’s just not acceptable. I expect better communication and accuracy when it comes to my earnings!|1|2024-12-18 16:54:56

3257|143|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and honestly, I'm fed up with the way things are being handled by the Operations department. First off, I was late on delivery—like, really late—and it shouldn't have gone down that way. The stress level during this trip was off the charts, hitting an 11 out of 10, and to top it all off, I experienced an assault while on the road. This is unacceptable, and it added to my overall trouble score of over 8, which is just ridiculous for any driver.

While I managed to get the delivery done on time, the lack of communication about traffic updates and rest stop availability was a real pain. I had to navigate multiple detours without any heads-up and ended up wasting time trying to find safe places to pull over. Plus, the stress level was at a solid 7 out of 10, and I shouldn't have to deal with that on top of everything else. It would be great if we could get better support so drivers aren’t left in the dark like that next time.|1|2024-02-25 21:01:38

3261|143|27|1|1|I just wrapped up route 27, and I need to voice my frustration with the Finance department regarding my mileage reimbursement. I clocked in 15.67 hours on this trip, and while everything else went smoothly, I noticed that my reimbursement amount doesn’t match the mileage I actually drove. It’s really frustrating to deal with these discrepancies, especially when I put in the effort to deliver on time and keep my stress levels manageable. This seems to be a recurring issue, and it’s starting to feel like a lack of appreciation for our hard work out here. Can someone please take a look into this and sort it out?

3263|143|50|1|1|I just wrapped up route 50, and while I managed to deliver on time, I have to say the experience was a real struggle thanks to some issues with the Operations department. First off, the route planning was a mess; I hit way too much traffic due to poor scheduling, which added unnecessary stress—my stress level hit a solid 9 out of 10 during that drive. Plus, I had to deal with a broken GPS device that was not updated with the latest road closures, making it even harder to navigate. With all this, I really think Operations needs to step it up to ensure drivers have the tools and support we need to make these trips less frustrating.|1|2024-05-14 07:07:55

The communication during the trip was nearly non-existent—no updates on delays or changes, which just added to my stress level of around 7. That’s a bit higher than I’d like for a routine haul. Also, the load I was carrying didn’t match up with the paperwork provided; it just felt like a complete lack of organization on your end.

I’ve reached out multiple times, but the responses have been slow and unhelpful, leaving me feeling frustrated and undervalued after all the hard work I put into this trip.

This kind of oversight not only affects my work but also my well-being on the road.|1|2024-01-20 18:50:24

First off, I didn’t make the delivery on time, which is frustrating enough, but to make matters worse, I encountered an assault while on the road that left me shaken and stressed to the max—my stress level hit a staggering 10.39 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that the Human Resources department hasn’t provided adequate support or guidelines to handle such dangerous situations, and I feel completely let down. My overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.05 out of 10, which speaks volumes about the lack of safety and support for drivers like me. I really need HR to step up and address these critical issues before someone gets seriously hurt.|1|2024-02-17 11:20:13

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level was off the charts at about 8.4 out of 10, and it felt like the Operations department dropped the ball on a few things. For starters, the routing was way off and added unnecessary time to my drive, not to mention the lack of communication about the tight delivery window made it even more nerve-wracking. I also faced issues with the load being improperly secured, which made me uncomfortable and added to my stress. I really think the Ops team needs to step up their game to ensure we drivers have the support we need out there.|1|2024-02-20 10:02:17

Not only did my delivery end up late, but I also faced a mountain of stress throughout the trip—my stress level hit a 9.39 out of 10, and I feel like I was juggling a million issues thanks to the lack of support from Finance. There's been a constant mix-up with my pay and reimbursements; it’s like they don’t understand how hard we work out here.

While I’m relieved to say that I completed the delivery on time, I ran into several issues with the reimbursement process for my expenses. It seems like the paperwork got lost or misplaced because I haven’t seen any updates on my claims, and it’s been over a week since I submitted everything. This is adding unnecessary stress on top of my already high workload, and I’m really hoping you can look into this and get it sorted out quickly. It’s disappointing to deal with these kinds of bureaucratic hiccups when I’m just trying to do my job efficiently.|1|2024-03-19 07:03:07

While I managed to deliver on time and didn’t face any serious threats, the lack of support and communication from HR has been a real headache. I’ve been trying to get clarity on some benefits and policies for weeks, but I feel like I'm just getting the runaround. The stress level I felt during this trip was an 8.8 out of 10, mainly due to worrying about these unresolved issues, and it's disappointing that HR isn't stepping up to help drivers like me who are trying to do our jobs effectively.

It’s frustrating to deal with these avoidable problems, especially when I’m out there putting in 16 hours on the road. We need better support and clearer communication to make our jobs smoother.|1|2024-05-22 18:56:12

The lack of communication regarding road conditions and unexpected detours really threw me for a loop, leading to unnecessary delays and a lot of frustration. Plus, the route directions were vague at times, which only added to the pressure. I’ve been driving for nine years now, and I've never felt this level of stress on a delivery.

When I went to submit my expenses, I noticed they’ve been dragging their feet on processing previous reimbursements, and now it feels like I’m constantly chasing after my money. It’s frustrating enough to deal with the stress of the road—my stress level hit a solid 7.5 during this trip—without having to worry about getting paid on time for the hard work I put in.

While I managed to make the delivery on time, I encountered several issues that really made this trip more stressful than it needed to be. First, the load was not secured properly, leading to constant worries about shifting cargo, which shot my stress levels up to an 8.5.

My pay for this trip was supposed to reflect the time and effort I put in, especially since I delivered on time, but it seems like there’s been a mix-up, and I’m not seeing the right amount in my paycheck. It’s disheartening when you put in all that hard work, and the numbers don’t add up.

Despite completing Route 26 on time after a grueling 13.3-hour drive, my stress level during the trip was pretty high at an 8.2 out of 10, and that’s not just because of the road.

While I managed to deliver on time without any major issues, the lack of support and communication from HR has been incredibly stressful, pushing my stress level to a solid 10/10.

The route was overly complicated and not well-planned, leading to what felt like endless detours, which dragged my trip to nearly 16 hours despite the on-time delivery. I was stressed out of my mind, reaching a stress level of 11.3 out of 10, and the lack of proper communication from Operations made it even worse.

3325|146|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, which took me over 12 hours to complete, and I’ve got to say, the experience was way more stressful than it should have been.

First off, I’ve been trying to get clarity on my pay and benefits for weeks now, and every time I call, I'm either put on hold for ages or get vague answers that don’t really help. It’s a real headache, especially considering the stress I already deal with on the road—I rated it a 7.5 out of 10 this trip. To top it off, I feel like there’s a lack of support when it comes to addressing driver concerns; it’s like we’re just numbers to them. I delivered on time and handled everything well, but the lack of responsiveness from HR is really starting to wear me down.|1|2024-04-17 12:40:48
3327|146|10|1|1|I'm writing to express my frustration with the Operations department after completing route 10, which took an exhausting 10.68 hours and ended up being late. To make matters worse, I faced an assault during the trip, which took my stress level through the roof—I'd rate it an 11.5 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that I had to deal with such a dangerous situation while also feeling like the support from our office was non-existent. The overall trouble score for this trip was 8.14 out of 10, and it’s clear that changes need to be made to ensure drivers’ safety and timely deliveries.|1|2024-08-14 21:15:34
3328|146|10|1|1|I just wrapped up route 10, and I gotta say, I'm really frustrated with the Operations department. While I managed to get the delivery done on time after spending over 13 hours on the road, the lack of communication about the route changes and the poor condition of the assigned trailer made my trip a nightmare. The trailer had issues that should have been sorted out before my departure, which added unnecessary stress to an already long drive—my stress level was through the roof at a 9.2! It's like nobody's paying attention to the details that keep us drivers safe and efficient out here. It feels like my concerns are falling on deaf ears, and it's really starting to take a toll on my morale.|1|2024-08-20 06:25:38
3329|146|45|1|1|I’m writing to bring to your attention some serious issues I encountered on route 45 that I believe need addressing. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level during the trip was through the roof (8.34/10), and I can’t ignore that. The lack of proper communication from the Operations department about route changes and unexpected delays really threw me off. It felt like I was driving blind at times, leading to unnecessary stress and fatigue over the 16.79 hours I was on the road. I think better coordination and clearer updates could really help us drivers out there, as my overall trouble score was still pretty low (1.88/10), which shows I can handle a lot, but this situation was just frustrating.|1|2024-08-22 01:16:00
3330|146|20|1|1|I just finished route 20, and while I delivered on time, I’ve got to voice my frustration with the Operations department. The route planning was a mess, leading to unexpected detours that added unnecessary stress to my trip, pushing my stress level to a solid 7 out of 10. I’m all for safety, but the lack of clear communication about road closures and construction zones made it a real headache. It’s like nobody in Ops is considering the actual driving conditions we face out there. Plus, the load was not secured properly, causing me to constantly check and adjust during the drive, which added to my overall trouble score. We need better coordination and support from Ops to make our jobs easier, not harder!|1|2024-08-24 19:07:55
3331|146|10|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Operations department regarding my recent route 10 delivery, which took nearly 8 hours and was not only late but also incredibly stressful. To make matters worse, I experienced an assault during the trip, which left me shaken and heightened my stress level to a near-breaking point of 9.8 out of 10. The lack of support and communication from the Operations team was glaringly evident, and it feels like my safety and well-being were completely disregarded. Overall, I’d rate this trip with a trouble score of 8.0, and I seriously believe that the Operations department needs to step up its game to ensure that drivers are supported and protected on the road.|1|2024-11-18 01:58:36
3332|146|42|1|1|I just wrapped up route 42, and I need to vent about some serious issues I faced with the Operations department. While I did manage to make the delivery on time, the stress level throughout that 11-hour trip was way too high—around a 9 out of 10. I encountered several frustrating delays due to poor route planning and a lack of communication about road conditions that weren't relayed to me beforehand. It felt like I was driving blind at times, and it really took a toll on my focus and overall safety. The overall trouble score was low, but these operational hiccups made the trip unnecessarily stressful, and it’s something that needs to be addressed to help us drivers do our jobs better.|1|2024-11-20 15:21:13
3333|146|23|1|1|I just wrapped up route 23, which took me a grueling 24.36 hours, and while I’m glad the delivery was on time, I have to say I'm pretty frustrated with the Finance department. The reimbursement for my fuel expenses is still pending, and it's been over a week since I submitted the receipts. This delay is really causing me some stress, especially since I rely on those funds to cover my costs. I’m also seeing discrepancies in my pay stub that don’t add up to what I was promised for the trip. It feels like I’m constantly having to chase down answers, and it's starting to wear me down. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-11-24 20:29:12
3334|146|14|1|1|I’m really frustrated after completing route 14, which took over 14 hours and was nowhere near on time.

The overall trouble I encountered was an 8 out of 10, and honestly, it’s unacceptable. The Operations department needs to do a better job of ensuring driver safety and timely deliveries; this isn't just about getting the cargo there, it’s about our well-being on the road too.|1|2024-11-26 00:13:32

While I managed to deliver on time, the stress level I experienced was through the roof, reaching about 12 out of 10, and I can't help but feel that HR is dropping the ball. There seems to be a serious lack of support and communication regarding the long hours and the toll they take on drivers like myself. I also had a hard time getting timely responses when I had questions about my schedule and benefits, which only added to my frustration on the road. It's tough enough dealing with the pressures of driving without feeling like HR is not in our corner.|1|2024-11-30 11:32:47

The stress level during the trip was through the roof, sitting at about 9.24 out of 10, and it feels like the Finance team is completely out of touch with the realities we face on the road. I had to deal with unexpected delays that weren’t accounted for in my pay calculations, which really adds to the pressure when you’re already running behind. It’s frustrating that I can’t rely on timely and accurate financial support, especially when I’m putting in so much effort to meet deadlines. This situation is taking a toll on my morale, and I hope you can address these issues promptly.|1|2024-12-02 04:27:43
3337|147|33|1|1|I just wrapped up route 33, and honestly, I’m pretty fed up with how things went down this time. Not only was the delivery late, but I also faced some serious issues during the trip that I can't just brush off. I encountered an assault that really shook me up, and my stress level was through the roof—like an 11 out of 10. On top of that, the overall trouble score for this trip was an 8.2, which is just unacceptable. I need the Operations department to step up and address these safety concerns and get the scheduling sorted out, because this isn't the first time things have gone sideways, and it’s affecting my ability to do my job effectively.|1|2024-01-13 12:14:38
3338|147|36|1|1|I just wrapped up route 36, and I need to voice some serious concerns about the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the overall experience was incredibly stressful, with my stress level hitting a 9.2 out of 10, mainly due to the lack of clear communication regarding my route and the frequent changes to my scheduled stops that were not relayed to me until the last minute. This kind of disorganization makes it really hard to plan my day effectively and contributes to an exhausting work environment. I also encountered issues with the routing software, which misdirected me multiple times, adding unnecessary hours to my trip. I think we really need to get on the same page about these logistics to avoid these headaches in the future.|1|2024-01-15 22:53:36
3339|147|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I’ve got to say, I’m pretty frustrated with the Finance department. Despite delivering on time after a grueling 10.61-hour drive, I noticed some discrepancies in my pay for this trip that just don’t add up. It's already stressful enough dealing with the long hours and traffic, and now I have to chase down missing funds? My stress level during the trip was already an 8.5, and this just adds to the frustration. I expect better communication and accuracy when it comes to our hard-earned wages.

3340|147|22|1|1|I just wrapped up route 22, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I’ve got to say I’m pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The route was way longer than it needed to be, and the lack of clear communication about the pit stops had me stressing out more than I should have—my stress level hit a solid 7.4 at one point! Plus, the last-minute changes to my schedule made it hard to plan ahead, which isn’t cool when you’re trying to keep everything running smoothly. Overall, my trouble score was low, but these hiccups really put a damper on what should have been a straightforward trip. I’d appreciate some better coordination and clearer info for future routes.|1|2024-01-21 05:01:45

The Operations department really dropped the ball on this one—there were multiple instances where I received conflicting information about my stops, which added unnecessary stress to an already long trip; my stress level was at a solid 7.7 out of 10. Plus, the lack of proper communication on loading times and locations made it feel like I was flying blind out there. I get that things can get hectic, but I expected better organization and support from the Operations team. Overall, it was a manageable trip with a trouble score of 2.5, but honestly, it shouldn't have been that way.|1|2024-01-27 12:51:28
3343|147|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I have to say, I'm pretty frustrated with the Operations department. The whole trip took me over 14.5 hours, and I was late on delivery, which is unacceptable. I understand that delays happen, but the lack of communication about traffic issues and route changes really added to my stress—my stress level hit a solid 7.5 out of 10 during the trip.

3345|147|39|1|1|I just wrapped up route 39, and I need to vent about the Human Resources department because I'm really frustrated with the lack of support and communication. I’ve been driving for four years now, and during this trip, which took over 11 hours, I felt like I was left completely in the dark regarding my benefits and time-off policies. It’s like nobody in HR wants to answer questions or provide clear information, which only adds to my stress level—seriously, it was at a 9.7 during the whole trip! I get that the job can be demanding, but feeling unsupported really amplifies the pressure. I hope HR can step up and provide better assistance to drivers like me who just want to do their job without added anxiety.|1|2024-04-20 03:31:16

I completed the trip in 13.17 hours, and while I made the delivery on time with minimal issues—my stress level was around a 7.5—I'm still waiting on my payment, which is well overdue. It’s disappointing to see that despite my efforts and timely completion, the financial side of things seems to be dropping the ball.

3350|147|43|1|1|I just wrapped up route 43, and I have to say, the experience was far from smooth, even though we managed to deliver on time. First off, the communication from the Operations department was severely lacking; I had to wait way too long for route details, which added unnecessary stress to my trip, pushing my stress level to a solid 9.5 out of 10. Plus, the GPS directions were off in a couple of spots, which made navigating tricky and time-consuming.

The trip took nearly 11 hours and I felt like I was running a marathon with all the mishaps along the way. First off, the GPS directions were way off, sending me down some sketchy back roads that added unnecessary stress and time to my journey.

While I did manage to get the delivery done on time, the experience was far from smooth. The dispatch provided me with outdated information regarding my drop-off location, causing unnecessary delays and added stress—my stress level was an 8.2 out of 10 during the trip. Additionally, the lack of clear communication about rest stops made it difficult to manage my breaks effectively, which contributed to the overall trouble I experienced.

I encountered multiple road closures that weren't communicated ahead of time, forcing me to scramble for alternative routes, and the fuel stops you guys suggested were either too far apart or closed when I got there, adding to the chaos.

Additionally, there were issues with the load—some of it was improperly secured, making the drive even more nerve-wracking. Overall, my trouble score was a 2.5, which isn't terrible, but it could’ve been way better if the Operations team had done their job right. We need to tighten things up to make our jobs easier and safer out there!|1|2024-07-26 07:04:47

3448|150|43|1|1|I just wrapped up route 43, and while the delivery went smoothly and I was on time, I have to say I'm really frustrated with the Finance department. After spending over 6 hours on the road, I expected my payment to be processed without a hitch, but it seems they’ve messed up my mileage reimbursement. I've checked the figures, and they’re way off; it feels like I'm being shortchanged for my hard work. To top it off, the communication from Finance has been terrible—no one’s answering my emails or calls, and I can't get a straight answer about when I can expect my payment. This kind of stress is just unnecessary, especially after a long drive. Can we please get this sorted out?|1|2024-01-31 14:45:42
3449|150|43|1|1|I want to bring to your attention some frustrating issues I encountered during route 43, which took me about 5.6 hours. While I managed to make the delivery on time, the whole experience was marred by poor communication from the Operations department, particularly regarding last-minute route changes that weren’t communicated until I was already on the road. This led to unnecessary stress and confusion, bumping my stress level up to a 7. I also found the load information provided lacked clarity, which made it difficult to plan my stops efficiently. I believe better coordination and clearer communication could significantly improve our operations and make life easier for drivers like me.|1|2024-02-03 09:03:55
3450|150|49|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 49, which took an exhausting 28.55 hours and, to top it all off, was not delivered on time. During this trip, I faced an assault that left me shaken and stressed, pushing my stress level to an unbearable 12 out of 10. The lack of timely support and communication from Finance made things worse, as I struggled to manage the situation while needing immediate assistance. To put it plainly, the overall trouble I encountered was an 8.17 out of 10, and the lack of proper handling from your department only added to my already overwhelming experience.|1|2024-04-23 03:03:47
3451|150|13|1|1|I just wrapped up route 13 and honestly, I need to vent about the Finance department. While my delivery was on time, which is great, I ran into some serious headaches with the mileage reimbursement for this trip that took me over 17 hours. I submitted the necessary paperwork on time, but it's been a week and I still haven’t seen a dime. It’s super frustrating when I’m out there busting my chops and then have to chase down payments that should be automatic. The stress of the trip was already way up there, and this just added to it. I really hope you guys can get your act together because this is becoming a recurring issue that’s wearing me down.|1|2024-04-29 04:15:13
3452|150|14|1|1|I just finished route 14, which took nearly 15 hours, and I’ve got to express my frustration with the Operations department. While I managed to deliver on time, the stress throughout the trip was through the roof, hitting a 9 out of 10, and that’s just unacceptable for a delivery. I encountered multiple delays at loading docks due to miscommunication with staff, which really messed with my schedule and added unnecessary pressure. Plus, I had to deal with faulty GPS information that directed me to a closed road, wasting even more time. This kind of oversight is not only stressful but also impacts our efficiency and morale. I really hope you guys can address these issues to make things smoother for all of us on the road.|1|2024-05-02 12:51:04
3453|150|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, and I’ve got to say, this trip was a nightmare from start to finish. First off, I didn’t deliver on time, which messed up my schedule and put me under a ton of stress—my stress level hit a ridiculous 13 out of 10. To top it all off, I experienced an assault during the trip, which is completely unacceptable and made the whole situation even worse. Honestly, my overall trouble score for this trip is an 8 out of 10, and I can’t help but feel like the Operations department is dropping the ball big time. We need better support and communication out there, because this isn’t just about delays; it’s about safety and being able to do our jobs without feeling threatened.|1|2024-05-07 22:44:39
3454|150|17|1|1|Hey team, I just wrapped up route 17, which took me a solid 10.19 hours, and while I managed to deliver on time, I’ve got to say I’m really frustrated with the Finance department. It’s been a hassle trying to get my reimbursement for fuel and tolls sorted out – I submitted all the necessary paperwork weeks ago, but it seems like no one’s even looked at it. On top of that, I’ve been getting conflicting information from different people about what I’m owed, which just adds to the stress of an already tough job. I’m at a stress level of 11/10 right now, and I feel like I shouldn’t have to chase down my money. Can we please get this resolved? Thanks.|1|2024-05-09 11:18:33
3455|150|49|1|1|I just wrapped up route 49, and while I managed to get the delivery done on time, I’ve got some serious beef with the Human Resources department. First off, the lack of communication regarding my schedule has been downright frustrating; it feels like I’m always left in the dark about my next assignments. On top of that, the promised perks for long hauls never seem to materialize, which is just plain disappointing after putting in the hours. I’ve been feeling stressed as hell during this trip, hitting a stress level of 9.5 out of 10, and I can’t help but think that better support from HR would ease some of that burden. Overall, I’m just really frustrated and hoping for some accountability and improvement in how things are handled on their end.|1|2024-05-11 09:39:28
3456|150|14|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Human Resources department after completing route 14, which took me 17.59 hours, and while I did manage to deliver on time, the experience was marred by unresponsive communication from HR regarding my recent request for time off. I had submitted my request well in advance, but I didn’t receive any confirmation or follow-up, which added unnecessary stress to my trip—my stress level was an 8.16 out of 10. It feels like HR is dropping the ball when it comes to supporting drivers like me who are just trying to balance work and personal life. I hope something can be done to improve this situation, as it’s really affecting morale on the road.|1|2024-05-13 04:04:56
3457|150|14|1|1|I need to raise some serious concerns about my recent experience on Route 14. First off, the delivery was late, which really throws a wrench in the whole operation and adds unnecessary stress. Speaking of stress, my level was through the roof—12 out of 10, no joke. To top it all off, I was actually assaulted during the trip, which is absolutely unacceptable and puts everyone at risk. With an overall trouble score of 8.17 out of 10, it’s clear that the Operations department needs to step up and address these issues before someone gets seriously hurt or we end up losing clients because of our unreliability. It's frustrating to deal with this kind of situation when we should be focused on getting the job done safely and on time.|1|2024-06-09 22:47:11
3458|150|17|1|1|I’m writing to express my frustration with the Finance department after completing route 17, which took nearly 10 hours and ended up being late on delivery. Not only was I stressed out of my mind, scoring a solid 17 out of 10 on the stress scale, but I also experienced an assault during the trip that added to my already overwhelming trouble score of nearly 9 out of 10. It’s unacceptable that I’m dealing with this level of chaos and the lack of support or communication from Finance is really making things worse. I feel like I’m out here risking my safety and sanity, and the least I should expect is proper backing from the company.|1|2024-06-17 13:18:46
